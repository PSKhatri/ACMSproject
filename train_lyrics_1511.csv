Casual,I Didn't Mean To,"Verse One:

Alright I might
Have had a little glare when I stared at ya ho
But I didn't know she was like that
She stared right back
My niggas warnin me that she was comin on to me
I react like a mack do I act cool
Just to test her cause I ain't no jester
I suggest her and her friend be outtie
Cause I don't want to make my pals get rowdy
And doubt me our friendship
But when lips touch
I go crazy in the clutch
Sorta like schitzo I forgets my bros and pals over gals
I didn't mean to but when you fiend you do
Strange things for the denim no matter who's in em
Grab a flooze then I'm in traffic
Don't laugh it might be your girl that I'm talkin about
I didn't mean to

Chorus: Repeat 2X

It ain't my fault that your girl got caught
It ain't my fault that your girl got caught (I didn't mean to)

Verse Two:

Another incident when I went
Way beyond what I should of done
John should of stopped before them drawers dropped
But I didn't ain't no quittin
Really didn't care who's girl I was hittin
I admit skinz ain't a reason to lose friends
But then again I didn't know, sorry
Accept apologies and live on
Are we goin hold grudges well oh fudge
Its a new year and I do fear
Ya actions ya actin shy
I mean ya need to be smackin
That hoe
Instead of tryin to front on me ya know
Thats exactly how I'm goin to be ya know
I run my game on any G ya know
Cause we the most entertainin
I meant to blame women
For makin me do what the Ak seem to
When you call I screen you
I didn't mean to

Chorus


Verse Three:

Why do fools be schememin dreamin
Actin like demons
Niggas don't give a fuck
Because they beat shit
To many girls front cute
When they want loot
They tell lies the swell guys
Can peep it and thats weak shit
Thats why I run game on every freak I get
Born in Oakland grew up pumpin Too Short
I know the rules on the flooze so who's short
I once had a ho who smoked blunts yo
She tried to get me so I looked at the front door
And now shes not with me so forget it
But every once in a while I'll hit it
And it happened to be your girl
I didn't mean to and I been through
Your relationship and I hate dumb dips
But I really can't trip when they ride my tip
I didn't mean to

Adam Ant,Something Girls,"Adam Ant/Marco Pirroni
Every girl is a something girl
Every girl is a something girl
Every girl is a something girl
She's got something
Every girl is a something girl
Every girl has a somehing smile
Every girl is a something girl
For a while
If I had three wishes I know mine
I would not ask the stars to shine
I wouldn't ask for gems or pearls
I'd ask for the something girls
Every girl is a something girl
From the whites of her eyes
To the tip of a curl
Every girl sends a something boy
With that something
When this old world won't treat you right
You're not feeling yourself tonight
Think of someone you can do
Relax and let that something through
Every girl is a something girl
She's got she's got something",happy,1982
Gob,Face the Ashes,"I've just erased it's been a while, I've got a world for sale
And now I walk away from it, it's better done secret
I never mouthed those words away, I wouldn't cause concern
Die in a crossfire runaway none of this exists
Someone is killing me

Turn him away, lay over there
His limb is red, I have all clear
Settle the wave I'm on my way
Dreaming of red, memories are worst

I feel abrasive worn and tired, don't think I could win
Take me to a place I adore and then seal me in
I'm not the one I swear I'm not, no matter how I felt
Die in a crossfire runaway, face the ash again
Someone is killing me",sad,2007
Lionel Richie,Tonight Will Be Alright,"Little darling 
Where you've been so long 
I've been out here thinking about ya 
And the feeling's real strong 
Well the time has come to celebrate 
You and me girl so sounds great 
Cause tonight will be alright 
Oh baby 

Little darling, come on 
Let's take a ride 
To a midnight honey town and set it on fire 
We don't want to be mad 
But we have to be cool 
You and me girl 
Let's break all the rules 
Cause tonight will be alright 
Oh my baby, I'm gonna say it again 
I can see us moving on 
Down the highway 
I can see us loving 
Till our hearts desire 
Anything you wanna do girl 
You just tell me 
Cause it's alright, cause it's alright 

Little darling, telling you no use 
Keep me thinking about you honey 
My soul's on fire

Blue Rodeo,Floating,"Lead Vocal by Greg

Well, these late night conversations
Leave a strange taste,
Like french cigarettes.
And these coloured drinks
that you keep on throwin' at me
Just keep on reminding me
I came to forget.

So now every night
You insist on reminding me
Of my lost possibilities
And the stains on the wall.
Well, I don't mean to complain
But it hurts just the same.
And now both of us know
The leaves will fall on their own.

Just throw me a line
That's all that I ask
Well, it's sink or swim and I'm goin' fast
I need love and it's you
And I feel like William Holden floating in a pool.

Yea, you tell me
Life is for living
It's best in the giving
But it's so hard to be free.
Still I do my best
But you refuse my gift
And now all that we share
Is a collection of tears.

Just throw me a line
That's all that I ask
Well, it's sink or swim and I'm going fast
I need love and it's you
And I feel like William Holden floating in a pool.

Right now I'm alive, I'm feelin' well
It's my life to live my way
So I'll keep daydreaming away
Who knows, maybe someday it will all come true
And I will get my way

The Dillinger Escape Plan,Setting Fire to Sleeping Giants,"First off let me say you look so tired...
Rest your head and shut your eyes
Empty ambition blankets the sky...
I'm thinking 'bout another world

Tonight
So drop the gown the game's over just push your face into the fight and it breaks my heart like dancing up all night ride so high we both start thinking 'bout another world tonight
And it feels so wrong like nothing we've ever...
Felt before

The stranger's candy takes you where you ought to be
In broken alleys, in the back of every street
Close your eyes tonight
Baby you can have it
Baby you can have it

Ooh baby gnaw me
Down to the bone
Soon you'll find I'm never gonna take you back home
Well there's so much you never told me
And there's not much I want to know
'cause your pretty face will do just fine
You'll be the star...

Of my every last show
Let's go for a long ride I'll show you places you won't ever want to leave

The stranger's candy takes you where you ought to be
In broken alleys, in the back of every street
The stranger's candy, broken alleys
Tonight we could bring it all down we could bring it all down

They think this body's a dead note dancing to the beat but they'll never see this corpse coming 'till it kills them",happy,2004

Five Bolt Main,Made Like This (Live),"Conclusions, illusions, of mainstream intrusions
I'm saying this is just your life
Brain of the main-frame, life
Your single one and only life
I'm starting from the back again, it's never ending
Ran off the track yes once again, the vibe is sending
So far from where I might have been, this message pending
I won't stop looking back again, the road is bending
Time exists on a band 'round your wrist, and the people you trust should be last on your list


We could solve the world's problems with just one wish, we were made like this
Time exists on a band 'round your wrist, and the people you trust should be last on your list

Willie Bobo,Spanish Grease,"Ain't no love
Ain't no love
Ain't no love
Ain't no love

We're missing in action living in a time when it's in fashion
To be gun flashing, blasting that's why we ain't lasting
All fastened, strapped ready for rivals harassing
Looking over your shoulder ducking cars that are passing
In my rumbo you hear that latin lingo
Guns shoot through at pachucos fuckin? sickos
With four nickels nobody walks around single
Get caught slipping they'll pull your card from a window
It's that simple locals get gaffled by barrio locos
Steal their spanish grease making them shed a tear like willie bobo
Over dollars, chains and rings things that are worth poco
A coco's out there stealing 'cause they're fiending for perico
A head crack will strike and attack for a sack
Pawn or sell your shit to buy a rock and bring that high back
That's why I strap it's my defense against those
Who are committing defense randomly becoming foes?
Shit is survival of fittest testing who's biggest and realest on the street
Feel this beware of killers, stealers and dealers
Rebel guerillas striking on policemen who give us
Hard times in the city where no love is with us

Ain't no love
Ain't no love
In the city?
In the city?

Ain't no love
Ain't no love
Ain't no love
Ain't no love

John Wesley,The Emperor Falls,"Brick by brick
stone by stone
dismantle the will of a man
strip his flesh and bone

Reach out your hand
the moment comes
blade catches the light of your eyes
the man slowly comes undone

Nobody noticed
no one saw a thing
all turned a blind eye to the fallen
and the bad luck he brings

You wake in the morning after
the sky's a color that you can't see
friends have fallen by the wayside
why isn't anyone talking to me
get those funny looks in the market
people you loved just stare
wander on with your hands in your pockets
even your girlfriend don't care

They've all come to watch the emperor
They've all come to watch the emperor
They've all come to watch the emperor

To watch the emperor fall

One part truth
three parts deceit
two parts shit that you made up
add passion for heat

Did ya hear he said this
can you believe he done that
can you believe the nerve of the man
let me at him tell me where he's at
wake to your fave in the mirror
see someone you don't recognize
stare at the changes in the reflection
you've become someone that you despise",sad,1998
Billie Jo Spears,It Makes No Difference Now,"Makes no difference now what kind of life fate hands me
I'll get along without you now that's plain to see
I don't care what happens next 'cause I'll get by somehow
I don't worry 'cause it makes no difference now

It was just a year ago when I first met you
I learned to love you and I thought you loved me too
But now that's all in the past and I'll forget somehow
I don't worry 'cause it makes no difference now

Now that we have really parted I can't believe we're through
I don't blame myself and I'm sure I can't blame you
I know that something had to happen and it happened somehow
I don't worry 'cause it makes no difference now

After all is said and done I'll soon forget you
Although I know that it will be so hard to do
Let things happen as they will and I'll get by somehow

Come on can't you see that I

I am stranded, caught in the crossfire.

I need some kind of kindness, some kind of sympathy oh, no

Save the strong lose the weak,
Never turning the other cheek.
Trust nobody don't be no fool,

I've read the same books again & again
It makes me wish I wasn't bashful
When it comes to other men

But if I could have my way
Darling you'd come home

Remember when you moved to Nashville
And the first time that we kissed
Remember when your mother found us
Remember that you're sorely missed

And when you make it back to Nashville

And I still buy two pairs of everything
So when you come home you & I'll be twins

NOFX,Stickin In My Eye,"When I look 'round, I only see outta one eye
As the smoke surrounds my head, the sauna
I hear the voices, but I can't make out their words
Saying things, saying things that
I got something sticking in my eye
Got something sticking in my eye
Got something sticking in my eye

I feel unusual from thinking
About the underground decay, God help me
Kill beneath the camera, watch the world begin to cry
It's not from pity
It comes from what's been sticking in my eye
Got something sticking in my eye
Got something sticking in my eye
Got something sticking in my eye
Got something sticking in
Got something sticking in
Got something sticking in my eye",happy,1992

Is sure to fail
I could crawl around the floor

You
I should learn to be man
Like you

Plug me in
And turn me on
Oh everything is moving here

I need my treatment
It's tomorrow they send me
Singing ""I am an American""
Do you?

Picture this
If I should make the change
I'd love to pull the wires from the wall!

And how can I try?
Here inside I like the metal

Carbed apart the madness that I stumbled from
But she fell away
She fell away
Shed me like a skin
She fell away
Left me holding everything 

Once the road lay open like a girl
And we drank and laughed and threw the bottle over
But she fell away
She fell away
I did not see the cracks form
As I knelt to pray
I did not see the crevice yawn, no 

Sometimes
At night I feel the end it is at hand
My pistol going crazy in my hand
For she fell away
O she fell away
Walked me th the brink
The fell away
I did not see her fall
To better days
Sometimes I wonder was she ever there at all
She fell away
She fell away
She fell away",sad,1986

Oversee the living

A wound unhealing

If time will set you free...

Time now to spread your wings
To take to flight
The life endeavor
Aim for the burning sun
You're trapped inside
But you can still be free...
If time will set you free...
But it's a long long way to go

Keep moving way up high
You see the light
It shines forever
Sail through the crimson skies
The purest light
The light that sets you free...
If time will set you free...

Sail through the wind and rain tonight
You're free to fly tonight
And you can still be free...
If time will set you free...
And go high like the mountain tops
And go high like the wind don't stop
And go high

Only for the purpose to mislead, what was once promising seeds 
Are now destroyed and misplaced with mischievious weeds for greed
The purpose, inseminate the bitches
Eliminate top rappers, throw their remains insides of ditches
Nigga political snitches, Abe me which is
The very reason I'm able to strike so vicious
Yea
Take these keys, that for years were not found
Allowing all Simeons to be freed thats locked down
It returns way back to the block
Only to cop more Smack, Rock from cops that act
not in a manner for you to prosper
You are Ab-so-lete unless
You can handle the ball during a full-court press
When the weak emotion of love fails to bring hope
Kneel to your master nigga, invoke the strongest emotion
known to mankind HATE!

can be taken out by the likes of you Apes, Kikes
conservative nigga loving Gooks, Spooks, and Dykes

Braces the fact that I'm prepared for vicious acts of war

God's plan is for us to seek and destroy man's false creation

Set up to destroy spades and Jews from hidden stations

No more smooching off of welfare for jiggaboos in the so-called hood

Saafir,Crawl Before You Ball (Album Version),"Intro:
Yo Saafir what's goin' on playboy?
Saafir: What's really goin' on?

Huh, you tell me baby.

Saafir:Hey, it's like this man.
I gotta let these motherfuckers know how to crawl man.

I know everybody tryin' to come up immediately.

Saafir:You know they don't got the motherfuckin' perseverance cause they
ain't have it hold up though. I gotta go and do this man.

Verse 1:
You can hear the ambition mobbin' in my po position
The intention is to come up
Do your grindin' pay the boss before you floss
And don't lose your mind and find discipline'
And stackin' your scratch
So it don't come up missin' in
As you're askin' the Lord for guidance
While you ridin'
Stickin' and movin' slidin'
In and out the game
Unless you realize you're sprung before you legalize your funds
All you track hustlers that was made for the corner
Dodgin' the coroner's office
I'm tossin' this at you
Now on some sermon type shit
I'm burnin' and I gotta write this
The mic got me ballin'
Shot callin'
It's the murk one like that
Sit back but not in starship
So I don't tarnish or rust
When I'm bustin' on the next jerk
Who swears he's ballin' but can't network
You better off with sexwork
The way you fucked in the game
It's a shame
I'm aimin' at the bathroom stall on all of y'all
With the H.J.s deflecting these hate rays
Until the sun falls
You acquired a dream
Crawl before you ball

Hook: (x2)
What you thought?
You was just gonna ball on the spot?
Let's be real
You gotta stack dollar bills before you get a mil
Gotta handle business before you choose to chill or you fall
Crawl before you ball

Verse 2:
All you pompous ass marks in Babylon yawnin'
Becomin' another nigga spawnin'
>From the trenches
The stench is unknown
I've been crawlin' like a two toed
Chameleon for so long
Writing these songs and ridin' these thongs
With bracelets on they ankle bone
That's anxious to moan
Like Neena Samone
Have a trick
Sickin' thinkin'
That we know it's on
You better crawl before you ball man
Before you fall man
Keep ya hoes off your payroll
Unless they crawl with you
And you know they all with you
And even then they won't fall with you
I'm like fuck 'em
I got to
It's a new sheriff in town his name is Reggie Mamoo
Ya hear?
More like Saafir
On a crawl
By watch how daddy ball
I'm all ears and all eyes
Recognize
I'm crawlin'

Bridge: (x2)
Baby baby let me kick my all to y'all
You gotta crawl before you ball
I've seen so many many soldiers fall
They didn't know you had to crawl before you ball

Verse 3:
You see gotta put in major work in at first
Before you burst
Crawl before you ball but never lose your thirst
When you ballin'
Or you gonna end up broke and butt naked with no garments on
While I'm makin' more cheese than Parmesian

Apply it to my walk then stalk

And I'm a stick to that plan
Now I'm a stay down with my folleys
The team then turn and brace God gave green

The Verve Pipe,Medicate Myself,"I hear you cryin' for me 
But I see the anger in your eyes
I want what will not judge me
I need what keeps me warm inside

A man without a purpose
Stares from the mirror on the wall
You think you know my problems
I think that you don't know my at all

I don't believe I suffer
Disease as you proclaim
And I don't believe that I should kneel and hang my head in shame

Held prisoner by a monkey
Strapped on behind my back
And while I sit ablaze 
The light is slowly fading into the black
So I

I've got to medicate myself again
I've got to medicate myself again
I've got to medicate myself again

Cause you don't need me hanging 'round
One more drink and I will be drowned

I know you hate to see me
As I defeat myself this way
You know you can't control me
You know I'm slipping day by day

Down into my obsession
Down in the hole where I belong
And when this fight is over
You will stay right here and I will be gone
So I

I've got to medicate myself again    3x

I found you broken 
And lying on the floor
An empty bottle in the drain
I put my hand right through the kitchen door

I've got to medicate myself again
Cause you don't need me hanging 'round
I barely get my coat off and you're already
Crawling down my back again
Yeah you get to watch me sinking down
One more drink and I will be drowned

I've got to medicate myself again",sad,2001

Dolly Parton,Letter To Heaven,"An old man was sitting at his table one day 
Writing a letter to pass time away 
His little granddaughter climbed up on his knee 
Saying won't you please write a letter for me 
Oh what must I say in this letter I pray 
Tell mommy I miss her since she went away 
I coming to see her real soon I hope 
He choked back a big lump that rose in his throat 

He sealed it and wrote on that big envelope 
To God up in heaven you'll get it I hope 
He stamped it and handed it to her to mail 
Her big eyes were shining her little face pale 

She was crossing the street to the box o'er the way 
And when she stepped out never looked either way 
A big auto hit her and sped away fast 
The little girls prayers had been answered at last 

The postman was passing and picked up the note 
Addressed to the Master and these words he spoke 
Straight up into heaven this letter did go 
She's happy up there with her mommy I know",sad,1971

I used to try to kill love, was the highest sin
Breathing insecurity out and in
Searching hope, I'm shown the way to run straight
Pursuing the greater way for all human light

How I choose to feel is how I am
How I choose to feel is how I am
I will not lose my faith
It's an inside job today

Holding on, the light of night
On my knees to rise and fix my broken soul
Again

Let me run into the rain

But don't you look too close, cause you just might see the person

I can't even see one friendly face, brothers fight brothers and sisters wink their eyes

While silver tongues bear fruits of poison lies, take a look at your children 

Born innocent, every boy and every girl, denying themselves a real chance

To build a better world, oh!   Dear Lord what's happening to your precious dream

I think its washing away on a bloody, bloody stream, yes, take a look at your children 

Before it's too late, and tell them nobody, nobody wins when the prize is hate

Oh, no, no, no It's not too late, we gotta tell all of our children

(Compton) Yeah, that's the name of the hometown
I'm goin down in the town where my name is all around
The suckers just be havin a fit, and that's a pity
But I ain't doin nothin but (claimin my city)
See, my lyrics I'm doublin up and provin to suckers that I can throw
I'm passin a natural ten or four or six or eight before I go
Yes, I'm definitely freestylin, all the while still profilin
Never a trickster, DJ Quikster steals the show
So now that's how I'm livin

Now Compton is the place where the homeboys chill, you see 
But then I found that it wasn't no place for me
Cause way back in the day somebody musta wanted me to quit
Because they broke in my house and cold stole my shit
They musta thought that I was gonna play the punk role
Just because my equipment got stole
But I ain't goin out like no sucker-ass clown
They found they couldn't keep a dope nigga down
So here's some bass in your face, muthafucka silly sucker-
Ass clocker, now you're duckin, cause you can't stop a brother
Like the Quiksta, because I'm true to the game
You're lame, and things ain't gonn' never be the same
Cause a nigga like the Quik is takin over
I really don't think I should have to explain
It, oh yeah, I'm a dog, but my name ain't Rover
And I'm the kinda nigga that's feelin no pain
Sometimes I have to wear a bullet-proof vest
Because I got the 'Cpt' sign written across my chest
A funky dope brother never ceases to impress
My name is DJ Quik, so you can fuck the rest
I'm comin like this, and I'm comin directly
Cause suckers get dain-bramaged if I'm doin damage quite effectively 
Rhymin is a battlezone, and suckers have no win 
Cause I'm a veteran from the C-o-m-p-t-o-n 
Kick it

Cradle Of Filth,Summer Dying Fast,"Through acrid clouds of summer flies
The garden swells with a thousand more wise
Forever flung to celestial dreams
Clawing at the grave of the dead Nazarene

I watch the storm approaching
The darkness calls my name
The trees are growing restless
They feel the season change
Their fruit has putrefied
Forbidden once and bound to die
The thread of life lies severed
On the brink of paradise

Grinning winds of hate unfurled
Towers tall that grip the sun
Talons stretch 'neath her veil
Reclamation, our time has come
Our time has come

Autumn spreads its golden wings
And lays the path for those unseen
A tangled web of evil spun at last
Winter spawn from barren thighs
To readdress, to slay the blind
And throw the reins untethered to the skies

They pray to the full moon rising
Diana moving with such infinite grace
Wrapped alone in a blanket of nightfall
How many secrets can they read by your face?

Will they know of majesty
Of beauty held in dream-dead sleep
And scarlet seas that bleed the frozen shores?
Will their God of bridled love
Assuage our rule from planes above
Or shrink in fear from chaos roused for war?

War!

Wrest askew the nails
That have held you, lurking deep
September prayers are waning
Burn the shrines of fettered sheep
Spearhead the insurrection
Of a world that seeks no end
We are what we are, what we shall be, again
Again

Appear; draped in terror
To the comfort of your kin
Stain the milky sunset red
And let the others

How to get these words off the tip of my tongue and out of my mind.

And then they took my blood type
They left a strange impression in my head

That I could leave this star-crossed world behind
But when they cut me open
I guess I changed my mind

And you know I might have just flown
Too far from the floor this time
'Cause they're calling me by my name

And they're zipping white light beams
Disregarding bombs and satellites
And that was the turning point

The dream maker's gonna make you mad

It's all in your mind.""

Well, now I'm back at home and
I'm looking forward to this life I live
You know it's gonna haunt me
So hesitation to this life I give

You think you might cross over
You're caught between the devil and the deep blue sea
You better look it over
Before you make that leap

And you know I'm fine
But I hear those voices at night
Sometimes they justify my claim

And the public don't dwell on my transmission
'Cause it wasn't televised
But it was the turning point
Oh, what a lonely night

The star maker says it ain't so bad
The dream maker's gonna make you mad
The spaceman says, ""Everybody look down.
It's all in your mind.""

The star maker says it ain't so bad
The dream maker's gonna make you mad
The spaceman says, ""Everybody look down.
It's all in your mind.""

My global position systems are vocally addressed
They say the Nile used to run from east to west
They say the Nile used to run from east to west

I'm fine
But I hear those voices at night sometimes

The star maker says it ain't so bad
The dream maker's gonna make you mad
The spaceman says, ""Everybody look down.
It's all in your mind.""

Well I feel pretty good
And I guess that I could

The girls can't stand it
When you do it right 
When they're up on the stand

You know my shirt's all wet
What a feelin' now baby
And the sound that abounds and
Resounds and rebounds 
Straight off of the ceiling

You can't do without
When you get that feelin'
You've got take'em out
Put that mic in my hand
And let me kick out the jams
Yes, kick out the jams
We gotta kick 'em out

So you got to give it up
You know you can't get enough

It drives you insane

These calloused fingers are wrapped
Around a black ball-point pen
These eyes don't wander as far
As they at one time did
I've seen the future, it's fading faster

No place that I'd rather be
Than right here, right now
There's no time that I'd rather be
Than right here, right now

I'm on the other end begging you
Pick up the phone
A shaking whisper is answering
Don't call anymore
Your voice is wasted 'cause I'm not listening

Freeze me in this moment
Thaw me in ten years
When the fires burned out and the smoke clears

No place that I'd rather be
Than right here, right now
No time that I'd rather be

That I am needing to know more about

And you will find me alone again

Oh, here we go, drop, top, ready to rock
And I'm not the one who brought down
And get to the top of a mountain pinnacle

Silent promotion you're feeling within yourself
Just like the ocean, you're crashing against the well
All of the time, you're forgetting about yourself
Looking back after the facts
What have you left yourself?

And if you follow every trend

And if you back stab your friends

If you ain't down 'til the end

Talk some shit and I'ma hit you with this quick block
Body parts are scattered and sealed up in ziplocks
With my steel cats get ill'd up to six blocks
You can try to run away but you won't get far
They call me Prozak, BITCH!, the knight of Templar
I'll open up your brain like the Deathstar
And lyrics come to me like ghosts from the graveyard

Since my birth I've been obsessed with the dead
Homocidal thoughts while I was bein' breast fed
I tried to kill myself but I survived instead
From pieces of a broken mirror, sliced my wrists, bled

Shit, my wicked rhymes will have you overdose
I'll leave your ass comatose
You try to play me close I'll levitate the smoke
When I hit the fuckin' stage be like, ""What's that smell?""

The radios afraid to play my wicked paragraphs
Go to the station lock and load up on they whole staff
And let them know the danger of us crossin' paths
And let it be known that I spit the truth like a polygraph
So jot it down homie, copy that
There's always room for another carbon copycat
They tried to run with my style but I got it back
It's hard to sound just like me with your head in half

Come undone bring me back to life

Tearing off the mask of man

Were just, you'll get anything you want
Broken hearts surround everything you wanna say
Which shows, why wait this for Falling in my path

It consumes me, I'll take it back
Give it back, to what it was

Sandi Thom,Wounded Hearts,"Just before I tell you standing in the rain 
I would have loved you like no other babe
But a poet needs his pain
And sometimes life can be so cruel
It will pick you up and drop you down again

So if you try to love me darling please refrain
I'm still searching for the pieces
Someone else once took away
You know I used to love with all my heart
But how the times they can change.

Oh my baby’s been calling and I want you to know
I'm not letting him down i'm just letting him go
Oh I never wanted to be apart
But I still don’t know if I’m a wounded heart.

I’ve seen a lot of heartache and I’ve walked a lonely road
They say the darkest times before the dawn
But the rooster hasn’t crowed
And when you wake up in the morning
Oh my darling I’ll be gone
 
Oh my baby’s been calling and I want you to know
I'm not letting him down i'm just letting him go
Oh I never wanted to be apart
But I still don’t know if I’m a wounded heart
No I still don’t know if I'm a wounded heart.

So many fools fall in love
And it’s a crying game
It’s a crying shame
That I’m not a fool in love
But I know what I’m feeling 
And my heart is still healing

Oh my baby’s been calling and I want you to know
I'm not letting him down i'm just letting him go

Gene Clark,Set You Free This Time,"Clark

The first thing that I heard you say 
When you were standing there 
Set in your way was that you were not blind 
You were sure to make a fool of me 
Cause there was nothing there 
That you could see 
That could go beyond your mind 
Now who's standing at the door 
Remembering the days before 
And asking please be kind 
It isn't how it was set up to be 
But I've set you free this time 

I have never been so far out in front 
That I could ever ask for what I want 
And have it any time 
Knowing this you found a thought for me 
That told you just what I should be 
And there I stood behind 
With all the ones that went before 
And memories that always seems to 
Tear me from my mind 
In front of what it is you seem me to be 
I've set you free this time 

I could never find a chance to choose 
Between a way to win or a thing to lose 
Because there was your stand 
On top of all the love you took 
There was only something 
You can look at lying in your hand 
Now who's wondering what has changed 
And why it can not be arranged 
To have each thing work fine 
It isn't how it was set up to be 
But I'll set you free this time",sad,1998
The Shirelles,Will You Love Me Tomorrow,"Tonight you're mine completely
You give you love so sweetly
Tonight the light of love is in your eyes
But will you love me tomorrow?

Is this a lasting treasure
Or just a moment's pleasure?
Can I believe the magic of your sighs?
Will you still love me tomorrow?

Tonight with words unspoken
You say that I'm the only one
But will my heart be broken
When the night meets the morning sun?

I'd like to know that your love
Is love I can be sure of
So tell me now, and I won't ask again
Will you still love me tomorrow?

So tell me now, and I won't ask again
Will you still love me tomorrow?
Will you still love me tomorrow?
Will you still love me tomorrow?",happy,1960
Panic At The Disco,Northern Downpour (Album Version),"If all our life is but a dream
Fantastic posing greed
Then we should feed our jewelry to the sea
For diamonds do appear to be
Just like broken glass to me

And then she said she can't believe
Genius only comes along 
In storms of fabled foreign tongues
Tripping eyes, and flooded lungs
Northern downpour sends its love

Hey moon, please forget to fall down
Hey moon, don't you go down

Sugarcane in the easy mornin'
Weathervanes my one and lonely

The ink is running toward the page
It's chasin' off the days
Look back at boat feet 
And that winding knee
I missed your skin when you were east
You clicked your heels and wished for me

Through playful lips made of yarn 
That fragile Capricorn 
Unraveled words like moths upon old scarves
I know the world's a broken bone
But melt your headaches, call it home

Hey moon, please forget to fall down
Hey moon, don't you go down

Sugarcane in the easy mornin'
Weather vanes my one and lonely

Jan Howard,Bad Seed,"Ain't been in Little Rock but two weeks and here I am now
Packing up and disappearing into thin air
Guys in Little Rock are cute but I can't make my heart take root
Cause bad seed won't grow just anywhere
I need lots of sunshine I need lots of raindrops I need to breathe the open air
I hope to beg your pardon your town just ain't my garden
Bad seed won't grow just anywhere
So honey kiss goodbye to your bad seed my love is not the kinda love you need
I could stay here with you but I wouldn't play fair
Cause bad seed won't grow just anywhere
And you're looking at the baddest of the bad seed

Next stop Jacksonville now I don't know but I got the feeling
I might just kinda like it somewhere round there
Hear tell there's fertile land white pearly silver sands
And bad seed won't grow just anywhere
I need lots of sunshine...",happy,1966
Sticky Fingaz,Oh My God,"(Sticky Talking)
C'mon man - oh my fucking God man..
Oh shit, what the fuck did I do?
It's all my fucking fault man, it's all my fucking fault
Fuck man, fuck am I doing man, why man
Why God, why did you have to take her? Fuck..

(Sticky)
Why? Why? Why God why?
Everything I love always seems to die
Answer me, speak to me, I don't hear you
Answer me, motherfucker I ain't scared of you
Is there even a God? Do you even exist?
What I gotta do to speak to you slit my wrists?
I'm talking to a God that I can't see
Can you see me? Can you see me?

(God)
Are you confused my son, and scared?
Let me make things more clear, so you're more aware

(Sticky)
Fuck who was that all this shit is freaking me

(God)
It is I God did you not say you wanted to speak with me?

(Sticky)
Bullshit I am talking to myself, I'm going insane

(God)
You are talking to yourself we are one of the same

(Sticky)
It can't be it must be the drugs I'm high
And if you are then why are we born if we live to die?
Is there life after death? What were we before birth?
Why is this whole earth plagued and cursed?
Is killing a sin is there life in other planets?
Is adultery wrong did you write the ten commandments?

(God)
Excuse me my son, one question at a time
We were never born, and we will never die
In the essence, there Is no such thing as death
How could I write commandments and not have them kept?
The soul is eternal you just change form
Then you come back with a new face on
You can not limit love unless you lack understanding
To answer you yes there is life in other planets
The futures a mystery the past is history
Today is a gift that's why it is called the present
Life is so simple unless you make it confusing
The wise ones stand us and the clever we are using

(Sticky)
Wait - God, there is so much I want to ask you
God, God? Where are you? God I need to talk to you

(Chorus)
If you could talk to God, exactly what would you say?
If you could talk to God, exactly what would you say?
If you could talk to God

(Sticky)
Tell me, are there psychics that can speak telepathically?

(God)
Yes but if you use more than one tenth of the minds capacity

(Sticky)
I can't think I feel life going down the drain
In the streets everywhere I am surround in pain

(God)
Don't think, your thoughts are just that- thoughts
Your feelings will really erase what you been taught
Feelings are the language of the soul the soul is truth
I speak through you to aware the youth

(Sticky)
But why let the suffering go on why not just stop it?

(God)
In order for anything to exist, so much is opposite
How can there be left if there was never right?
How can something know death if it never knew life?
How can you lose, if nobody won?
How can it be dark if there was never a sun?
That which is not grandeur, the soil still blessed
Form must exist for part of themself to manifest

(Sticky)
But I never asked to be born, I hate my life
And if you are God dammit then show me the light
And tell me- what's the meaning of life?

(God)
The process of all life
is an ongoing, never-ending process of recreation of self

(Sticky)
Is God a he or she is there one true religion?

(God)
I'm the Alpha, the Omega, the beginning and ending
We are all one and everything is living

(Chorus)
If you could talk to God, exactly what would you say?
If you could talk to God, exactly what would you say?
If you could talk to God",sad,2000

Of the loving that I've missed

And if life were not unfortunate
And reason blew like summer through the trees
I would stop to let you catch me
But I think that you would find me on my knees


And it's gonna be another long one tonight
It's just me and my well-intentioned spite
I said someone did this to me
But no one did, there's no injustices
I just can't afford to be right no more
I bought myself another bad dream tonight
With these little boys in my head sleeping tight
It's gonna be another long one tonight


There is comfort in a memory
And in roses just before you cut them down
There is danger in most everything
That's all the better when it's not around
And the last time I had the sense to notice 
You were right here being kind
But if I think that you are with me
Then I know that you can always change your mind


And it's gonna be another long one tonight
It's just me and my well-intentioned spite

And we gotta leave by night
Before that river takes us down
We gotta find somewhere that's dry
We gotta run like we've never run,
Or we're gonna lose the light.
If we don't get to a higher place and
Find somebody who can help somebody,
Might be nobody no more

Well, I fool myself and I don't know why
I thought we could ride this out
I was up all night making up my mind
But now I got my doubts
I got my eye on the waterline
Trying to keep my sense of humor
But if we don't get to a higher place and
Find somebody who can help somebody,
Might be nobody no more

We gotta get to a higher place
And I hope we all arrive together
We gotta get to a higher place
If we wanna survive the weather

I remember walking with her in town,
Her hair was in the wind
I gave her my best kiss
She gave it back again
When I add up what I've left behind
I don't want to lose no more
But if we don't get to a higher place and
Find somebody who can help somebody,

Lupe Fiasco,Streets On Fire (Explicit Album Version),"(Intro - Matthew Santos)
Tonight...
The stars are aligned and the planets colliding
And the plan is arriving and she's out there smiling
The fear is upon us, the skies tried to warn us
Your parents are goners, no children to mourn
It's driving me crazy, this war is my lady
These bombs are our babies and God is amazing
The tick of the timer, the slip of your rival
The pimps and the rise of your pulse, where you'll find her
Hey hey 

(Chorus - Matthew Santos)
Death is on the tip of her tongue
And danger's at the tip of her fingers
Streets are on fire tonight
Death is on the tip of her tongue
And danger's at the tip of her fingers
Streets are on fire tonight

(Verse One - Lupe Fiasco)
Disease, the virus is spreadin' in all directions
No safe zone, no cure and no protection
No symptoms to find, the signs of an infection
No vaccines, remedies and no corrections
Quarantine your dreams and sever all connections
Don't let 'em in not a friend, not a reflection
Everybody's got it and wants you to have it next and
Don't accept 'em if you want to stay as an exception
No pill can heal the ill of this
Sickness some are still in doubt of its existence
Some call it forgiveness and some call it the vengeance
Some say it's an exit, some say it's an entrance
The poor say the rich have the cure
The rich say the poor are the source
Revolutionaries say it's psychological war 
Invented by the press just to have something to report
Some say the first case came from a maternity ward
Some say a morgue, some say the skies, some say the floors
""Whores,"" say the nuns, ""nuns,"" say the whores
And everybody is sure
The scientists say, ""it only infects the mind""
The little boy said, ""it only infects the girls""
The preacher man said, ""it's gonna kill off the soul""
A bum said, ""it's gonna kill the whole wide world""

(Chorus - Matthew Santos)
Death is on the tip of her tongue
And danger's at the tip of her finger
Streets are on fire tonight
Death is on the tip of her tongue
And danger's at the tip of her finger
Streets are on fire tonight

(Verse Two - Lupe Fiasco)
Believe! Some say the neon signs by the loud speakers repeatin' that everything is fine
A subtle silence to demolish the trouble conscience of accomplished with no knowledge and every freedom denied
Every dream is designed and broadcasted from the masses to the masses from the antennaes on top of the shrines
Was fine and received and planted during the panic and surely it reports back everything in your mind
Everything is lyin', everything is dyin'
Everying is a rule, everything is a crime
Everything was here then everything rewind
New weather burned the feathers off everything flyin'
(And she likes it, and she loves it)
The sadness, the madness, the bad shit, the lavish, the fastest, the clashes
The ashes to ashes, everything intertwined
My femme fatale, my darlin' fallen angel
Once caught her changin' the batteries in her halo
Receipt for wings and everything that she paid for
And the address to the factory where they made those
The scientist said, ""she's already inside my mind""
The little boy said, ""what happened to all the girls?""
The preacher man said, ""she's gonna kill off the soul""
The dope boy said, ""it's the whole wide world""

(Chorus - Matthew Santos)
Death is on the tip of her tongue
And danger's at the tip of her fingers
Streets are on fire tonight
Death is on the tip of her tongue
And danger's at the tip of her fingers

A subculture in a kaleidoscope of fashion
Prowl the streets of Harajuku (Harajuku, irasshaimase)

Super lovers, tell me where you got yours (at the super lovers store)
Yoji Yamamoto, I'm hanging with the locals
Where the catwalk got its claws, all you fashion know-it-alls
With your underground malls in the world of Harajuku
Putting on a show when you dress up in your clothes
Wild hair color and cell phones your accessories are dead-on

You're so original, girls, you got the look that makes you stand out
Harajuku girls, I'm looking at you, girls
You mix and match it, girls, you dress so fly and just parade around (arigato)

I'm fascinated by the Japanese fashion scene
Just an American girl, in the Tokyo streets
My boyfriend bought me a Hysteric Glamour shirt
They're hard to find in the states, got me feeling couture (it's really cool)
What's that you got on? Is it Comme des Garçons?
Vivienne Westwood can't go wrong, mixed up with second-hand clothes

Your underground culture, visual grammar
The language of your clothing is something to encounter
A Ping-Pong match between Eastern and Western
Did you see your inspiration in my latest collection?
Just wait 'til you get your little hands on L.A.M.B.
'Cause it's (super kawaii), that means (super cute in Japanese)
The streets of Harajuku are your catwalk

All pretensions disappear
Now our impulses will bite
At the ankles of our fear

Whoever is on the front line is gettin' struck first
We mercinaries, fuck turf
Every verse is varied, I bust first
Mayday, Natural Elements controllin' the ship
Rollin' a spliff that'll probably put my soul in a twist
But I remain bonin' a bitch
Got her buck-naked posin' for flicks
Actin' like she was never known for the shit
But I look over the shoulder and see the enemy lookin'
Physically strong but mentally shooken
And for penetentiary bookin's this shit happens
Get orders from my nigga Charlemagne the ship Captain
You sound like a bitch yappin' 
This shit is all Natural to us
Like blowin' endo out the window in the back of the bus
I move back and I bust
Rapid fire
You actin' flyer
Now your family's in black attire
With mad desire
When we caught you in the line of duty
You had it in your mind to shoot me
But every soldier of my kind sollutes me
Now I'm reclinin' with a Lucy
All of my niggas
Smoke it down to the filter
Holdin' a frown with a picture
You smell the smoke when I walk past
You saw blasts
You should've known about the drama in my warpath.

[Chorus]
Mayday Mayday, raise the white flags, time for the payday,
Payday, and it's like that, out shit is World Wide, North, South, East,
And West, put on your shield, lets see who's the best. Repeat 1x

[Verse 2: Mr. Voo-Doo]

You feel the burnin' emission
You squirm in submission
No terms and conditions
Ya'll confirm my suspicions
That ya'll are bitches that resemble Men
Like female Tennis players at Wimbledon
Why you tremblin'?
Shook like the ricter
My voice raise waves
And make ya'll change ways like crooks turnin Muslim
Blast shots burnin' your Bosom
Like bitch cramps
You got lucky your people told you switch camps
Or get damp with plenty led
I'm like a beast with many heads
Sort of like the Predators dreads
I got more arms than Dr. Octavious
Rock your whole block radius
I be the bomb
And I bleed nitrogliceren if you slice my palm
The Don been gone for how long from the rap biz?
Wet more domes than John the baptist
When the gat spits
It ain't over 'till the last man's limbs
Are twisted like he was doin Yoga
In fact my Pistol's longer than the Jokers
I ignite Mag's
Leave your toe wearin' a white tag
So, ya'll niggas better raise the white flag.

[Verse 3: L-Swift]

I swear theres a war in the air in the New York streets
You talk beef?
You had a swollen Melon, now you humble
With loaded weapons, nowhere to run to
We mega high, jet in the sky, droppin' bombs, 
Prepare to crumble as we rock on, 
Beware of the jungle with Anaconda's
Don't puff too much 'cause the enemy smells the Marijuana
We blastin' every object in Combat with honor
So yo, remember the agenda with the plan of action
No retreat, no surrender, keep the cannons blastin'
We blastin' heat 'till each member turns into has-beens
Soldiers bangin', who's click'll get done?
My crew can taste victory at the tip of the tongue
Always prepared physically, take the clip for the gun
And put it in, 'cause when it's on how many niggas'll run?
You said we couldn't win, bullets in ya flesh, cave in your chest
You pullin' for breath, I'm claimin' your death
You shouldn't've stepped, war paint on my chest
Fatigue green and black
And the heat reacts
To make you bleed like hemophiliacs
See me strapped, heavily armed, repetitively
Releasin' caps 'till the enemy's gone, definitely
My people pack metal for me, let a legend be born
I declare war, (What mothafucka!) and it's on.

Neil Sedaka,Because Of You,"Because of you there's a song in my heart
Because of you my romance had its start
Because of you the sun will shine
The moon and stars will say you're mine
Forever and never to part

I only live for your love and your kiss
It's really paradise to be near you like this
Because of you my life is now worthwhile
And I can smile because of you

I only live for your love and your kiss
(I only live for your kiss)
It's paradise to be near you like this
(To be near you like this)

Because of you my life is now worthwhile
And I can smile because of you

A Static Lullaby,Rattlesnake!,"God damn, holy diver. You made it right back to my bed. Manifested lips that whisper kiss.
That whisper kiss. Hey, hey ,hey. Pull the shades. I'm gutted. Guilty, played. And lonely.
I admit you wont see me again. My end is desperately engaged. Dark, departed, hollow.
You see I'm just a shadow. This ravenous beast is chasing shame. A shadow he remains.
How will my voice carry tonight? How do i look under these lights? Shove my head into the grand ivory keys.
Maybe this will teach me how to sing. Fuck hope, I'm a terror. Heavyweight human disaster.
I think I found Love. but what's love? When we cant be loved? Burn, burn, burn it down.
Icarus just hit the ground. To the youth that thought they could fly. I bottled up just drank up and died.
Palest white. I'm blues and reds. This patriot is long past dead. Forever ending. Remain but still gone.
Oh god I fear the steel. Oh how I fear the steel. Burn. My end is desperately engaged.",sad,2008
Nights Like These,Ghost Town Rituals (Album Version),"And when I open my eyes I see the end of
An ending life I've forgotten how to live.
I keep forgetting, I keep rebuilding.
This is when I say I'm done.
I haven't learned.
No one will show me, so I go on my own.
Honestly, I'm so fucking pitiful.
Don't tell me what I've heard before.
Destined to walk another day alone.
This day is dying.
This day is fucking dead.
Just shine my way back home.
You can stay if you find comfort.
Don't speak.
Just breathe instead.
Just don't leave me alone.
I don't just need it, I deserve it.
I want what I promised myself.
I want what you promised us all.
I'm coming to terms.
This is the end of denial.
Sometimes things just fall apart.
Angels laugh above me and demons wait below.
I'm naked, bare, and broken, ready to go home.
Now I need you more than ever.
And when heaven overlooks me I'll need you there to pick me back up",sad,2006

And you'll make me happy the rest of the days
Put your arms around me then I'll be your slave
Cause just a little lovin' will go a long way

Even Adam set the pace and started in a whirl
I met you and now I know that you're the one for me
Come on back and you will plainly see

Just a little lovin'...

Tonight I'm finding a way
To make the things that you say

I walk a fine line
Between the right and the real
They watch me closely
But talk is cheap here
Like a weightless currency
Your words don't mean shit to me

She's been shaking it since she was sixteen
Skips across the tables acting out her passion play

You take a gamble, got shot for romance

Chains, chains pulling you down
Chain of love that turns your world around
Chains chains pulling you down
Chain of love that turns your world around

Without a warning Jeannie took off one night
Jack got so mean boy, he just had to fight
He died on the floor someone else evens the score
Back on the tables Jeannie's romance had died
That one look of love that told her a lie
And for her there's no waves crashing on seashores

""I'm not sure anymore...""

And now, amidst the waves and the cloudless skies
That'd blanket the year before
I watch my life wash ashore

Have you ever been a part of something 
That you thought would never end
And then of course it did?
Have you ever felt the weight inside you
Pulling away inside your skin
And then something had to give?

Now the lines are drawn
Is this feeling gone?
The best parts of this have come and gone
And now there is all this is
With the reasons clear
We'll spend another year
Without direction, full of fear
But now things will be different

There's nothing simple when it comes to you and I
There's always something in this everchanging life
And there probably always will
Now that time is getting harder to come by
The same arguments are always on our mind
We've killed this slowly fading light

Now the lines are drawn
Is this feeling gone?
The best parts of this have come and gone
And now there is all this is
With the reasons clear
We'll spend another year
Without direction, full of fear
But now things will be different

And now something 
Has kept me here too long
And you can't leave me 
If i'm already gone

Well now something (hey) 
Has kept me here too long
And you can't leave me (hey)
If i'm already gone

Now let's say that something (hey) 
Has kept me here too long
And you can't leave me (hey)
If i'm already gone

Now that we
Make the same mistakes, we're always hanging on
Break those promises we're always leaning on
All this time spent waking up
I keep this line open to get this call from you 
Speak the words
That keep me coming back to you
Now this time it's all different

Now something has kept me here too long 
And now I'm gone...",sad,2001

Feel like a lady, and you my lady boy

You should be stronger than me
But instead you're longer than frozen turkey
Why'd you always put me in control?
All I need is for my man to live up to his role

Always wanna talk it through, I'm okay,
Always have to comfort you every day
But that's what I need you to do. Are you gay?

And all those who seek it shall find it
A pardon for all who believe
Hope for the hopeless and sight for the blind

To all who've been born in the Spirit
And who share incarnation with Him
Who belong to eternity stranded in time
And weary of struggling with sin

Forget not the hope that's before you
And never stop counting the cost
Remember the hopelessness when you were lost

Were blessed with the instinct to survive.

This is for those who escaped the tourment,
You know real courage,
You are as diehard as they come.
This is for those who never wavered,
You are fearless,
You are as diehard as they come.

YOU! - ARE! - AS DIEHARD AS THEY COME!!! (x4)

Never waver, never falter,
Remain, DIEHARD!

YOU! - ARE! - AS DIEHARD AS THEY COME!!! (x2)",sad,2006
Sister Hazel,Walls And Cannonballs (Album),"I think I know a way
Around this mess we're in
But you'll have to think about me for a while
Like your long lost friend
Cause you see, I see right through you
Past the smile to the truth that's hard to hold
Like the secrets of your rival
That paints them like a fool

You look just like a million dollars
But I think that you're nearly almost spent
And you're dying on the inside
You're lying on the inside
But don't fall apart
We can start again

Walls and cannonballs
Make unlikely friends
It seems they're destined to keep the other out
Or knock the other down
All they'd have to do is nothing
But maybe sleep a little late
And agree to let the other be
To twist their likely fate

You look just like a million dollars
But I think that you're nearly almost spent
And you're dying on the inside
You're lying on the inside
But don't fall apart
We can start again

You look just like a million dollars, baby
But I think that you're nearly almost spent
And you're dying on the inside
Yeah, you're lonely on the inside

You look just like a million dollars
But I think that you're nearly almost spent
And you're dying on the inside
Yeah, you're lying on the inside
But don't fall apart",happy,2010

Mary Black,Turning Away,"Chorus

In darkness we do what we can
In daylight we're oblivion
Our hearts so raw and clear
Are turning away, turning away from here

On water we have walked like the fearless child
What was fastened we've unlocked revealing wondrous wild
And in search for confirmation
We have jumped into the fire
And scrambled with our burning feet through uncontrolled desire

Chorus

There's a well upon the hill from our ancient past
Where an age is standing still holding strong and fast
And there's those that try to tame it
And the carve it into stone
Ah but words cannot extinguish it
However hard they're thrown

Chorus

On Racherie they have worked with their island dreams
By Lough Cleggan they have nourished in the mountain streams
And in searching for acceptance
They have given it away
Only the children of our children
Know the price they had to pay

Chorus",happy,1999
Owl City,Panda Bear,"I'm moving to Tokyo
'Cause I'm tired of San Francisco
My contracts are finally void
And I am getting out
On houses and building tops
I swallow the beams and sun drops
If my echos could reach your ears
Then I could save my calls
What happens when I'm above
The east river when you are in love?
We're staring at all these lights
And I am going blind

Fill all of the Navy yards
With hard working security guards
'Cause the numbers are wearing off
My plastic access cards
How can I begin to say
I feel better off when we stayed
In Paris on winter nights
Beneath a snowy veil?
Content like a panda bear
Still breathing the fresh mountain air
I'll put on a diving tank
And sing when I inhale",happy,2007
The Rascals,Nubia (LP Version),"Oh Nubia Nubia Nubia, the word is love to me
Your beauty and the gentle magic of your soul live here in my memory
Golden evenings in pink white veils
Sounds of the river telling ancient tales
Dreams return me to you,
Fire flows in deep blue

Oh Nubia Nubia Nubia, the ringing in my ear
As I wander through another life in search of someone soft and sweet I once held near
Time glances the other way,
Life’s sweet shadow makes night his day
Brings me closer to you,
Paints my heart a deep blue

Whispers of eternity
Bridges life’s sweet mystery
To sleep I go and hear the name
Nubia Nubia Nubia Nubia...

Soft heart wait another day,
Flaming boat will take you away
Then at the mystery’s end,
I won’t have to pretend, 'tend, 'tend

All kind of gold at rainbow's end, now

Despedazo mi razón
Se destruye algo de mí
Cada día pienso en ti
Pienso un poco más en ti

Cada día pienso en ti
Pienso un poco más en ti
Cada vez que sale el sol
Busco en algo el valor 
Para continuar así
Y te veo así no te toque
Rezo por ti cada noche
Amanece y pienso en ti
Y retumba en mis oídos 
El tictac de los relojes
Y sigo pensando en ti

Y sigo pensando.....

Everyday, I think of you. 
I think a bit more of you 
I take apart my heart... 
Something in me is destroyed... 
Everyday I think of you. 
I think a bit more of you... 
Everytime that the sun comes out 
I look for a bit of valor 
to continue. 


And I see you, I didn't touch you that way. 
I pray for you every night...

And it rumbles in my ears

I'd search the moons of Endor 
I'd even walk naked through 
The deserts of Tatooine

Princess Leia, where are you tonight? 
And who's laying there by your side? 
Every night I fall asleep with you 
And I wake up alone

And even though I'm not as cool as Han 
I still want to be your man 
You're exactly the kind of 
Alderranian that I need

But when you were available, I was 
Drinking Colt 45's with Lando 
I was hanging out in the cantina 
On Mos Eisley

A mortal man to rise again 
Have been rewritten to cleanse our sins

Cannot perceive the harsh realities that be 
Their savior has risen
To bring about the Christian holocaust

Far beyond a dream he rises from torment divine 

God is in me but now that I can see 
They're putting out my eyes 

Compulsory resurrection 
Will bring an end to their infection 
For how much longer can they defend 
An artificial savior which bleeds like men

Their sordid martyrs up upon a cross",sad,2008

Around and there's nothing but swine. You trust his
Lies 'cause they're easy to hear, You gave all your
Faith now your faith disappeared. Frontal Lobotomy.
Invent your god; put your faith in the sky, But you're
Sill worried if you're trusting a lie. You pray so
Hard and you claim he talks back, But I hear voices
Too after I smoke some crack. Hypocrisy - the way of

There's nuclear power to light up the dark
There's national health and ice in the fridge
And the occasional cow on a motorway bridge
There's extended credit on easier terms
And something to kill all known household germs
There's sofas and armchairs and washing machines
Stars on Sunday, fish fingers and beans

I don't know if I'm that strong.
I don't know where we went wrong but somehow it's over.
In my mind I see you clearly.
In my dreams I feel you near me.
I want to know, does this feeling go away? 

Like shooting stars we shine and then we fade,
breaking the promises we made.
What about the promises?
What about the promises we made?
What about our plans for forever?
Did they scare you?
Did you need to get away? 

You taught me many things.
Like how it feels to miss someone so bad it feels like a part of you is missing.
I can tell you one thing.
Now that you have gone I never will forget you.
You left your mark.

Say nothin' ever lasts

Before I knew your name
And I need you

They'll never be a cure

Anti-Flag,This Is NOT a Crass Song,"You're walking down the street in the middle of the day
The sun is shinning brightly everything is quite OK
But then you hear this song, it makes you stop and yell out, HEY!
You might think that it is...

BUT THIS IS NOT A CRASS SONG!

You might think that it is but I'm telling you it ain't!
Although I will admit it sounds like something they might write
It's a happy little ditty makes you stomp and move your feet
You might think that this is...

BUT THIS IS NOT A CRASS SONG!

Masterpieces don't usually get written in a minute
But this one took just seconds or even less time to pen it
But don't be too amazed 'cause it's just got one verse and chantin'
You might think that this is...

Ahh...right..it's not a crass song is it?

The guitar rift is real savage and it ain't all that on time
The vocals are so Cockney that they may just blow your mind
And it's got made up words like, icklee, zicklee, vin, and plime
You might think that it is...

BUT THIS IS NOT A CRASS SONG!

We like to play it in the morning like to play it in the night
Do yourself a favor matey, sing it instead of starting fights
After only just one verse I'm telling you you'll feel all right
You might think that it is...

BUT THIS IS NOT A CRASS SONG!

Play it when you're walking, walking down the street
Play it when you're riding on your bike or on your feet
Doesn't really matter ' cause it's really really neat
You might think that it is...

Ahhh...

Sing it to your mommy, sing it to your dad
Sing it to your new girl friend or the one that you just had...

Rickie Lee Jones,Skeletons (Live Acoustic Version),"She was pregnant in May
Now they're on their way
Dashing thru the snow
To St. John's, here we go

Well, it could be a boy
But it's okay if he's girl
Oh, these things that grow out of
The things that we give

We should move to the west side
They still believe in things
That give a kid half a chance

When he pulled off the road
Step in a waltz of ted moon-beams
Said he fit an APB,
A robbery nearby

And he go for his wallet
And they thought he was going for a gun
And the cops blew Bird away

Some kids like watching Saturday cartoons
Some girls listen to records all day in their rooms
But what do birds leave behind, of the wings that they came with
If a son's in a tree building model planes?

Shelby Lynne,Old Times Sake,"Before you go and walk out on me
Take a look around and tell me what you see.
Cause here I stand like an open book
Is there something here you might have overlooked.

And it would be a shame if you leave
And find that freedom ain't what you thought it would be.

The years we had were not all bad
In fact I know the good outweighed the bad.
And now you say that you've grown tired
And you want to be by yourself a while.

It would be a shame if you go
And find that freedom was a long time ago

I know you can't stand for chains to bind you
But they just keep on driving us apart.
And you could go where I would never find you
But could you go far enough to get away from you're heart.

So one more time for old times sake
Come and lay your head upon my chest.
Please don't throw this moment away.
We can forget the bad and take the best.

And if you don't have nothing left to say
Let me hold you one more time for old times sake.
And if you don't have nothing left to say
Let me hold you one more time for old times sake.",sad,2005

Towards the hidden sun

Climb to her fingernail and leap

And let the jet stream set you down

Are you gonna die in a raging fire ball?

She sees a fighter pilots mission and she wonders why

Do you like what you see?
I'll dance for you
And you'll dance for me

Who says a woman cannot serve?
It would be my pleasure
Who says it is not my destiny
To let you control me

CHORUS
Underneath the disco light
Everybody's feeling alright
Get on your hands and knees
And praise the new deity
Serve the ego, serve the ego

Two ships sailing on a neon sea
Eat the flesh, spit out the seeds
Feathered hair and lam?(pronounced la-may)heels
What turns me on is so surreal

Oh no

Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds,Still In Love,"The cops are hanging around the house
The cars outside look like they've got the blues
The moon don't know if it's day or night
Everybody's creeping around with plastic covers on their shoes
You're making coffee for everyone concerned
Someone points to this and someone points to that
Everyone is saying that you should lie down
But you ain't having none of that
And I say to the sleepy summer rain
With a complete absence of pain
You might think I'm crazy
But I'm still in love with you

Hide your eyes, hide your tears,
Hide your face, my love
Hide your ribbons, hide your bows
Hide your coloured cotton gloves
Hide your trinkets, hide your treasures
Hide your neatly scissored locks
Hide your memories, hide them all
Stuff them in a cardboard box
Or throw them into the street below
Leave them to the wind and the rain and the snow
For you might think I'm crazy
But I'm still in love with you

Call me up, baby, and I will answer your call
Call me up but remember I am no use to you at all

Now, you're standing at the top of the stairs
One hand on the banister, a flower in your hair
The other one resting on your hip
Without a solitary care
I fall to sleep in the summer rain
With no single memory of pain
And you might think I'm crazy
But I'm still in love with you",sad,2003

And someday we will lay ourselves to rest

Some days, I can feel you burning through my veins
I look to the light
I can feel my eyes burn
Looking down, the ground beneath is falling fast
Shedding the cares of this world

I'm sick
God knows I'm sick of making
Now I'm so sick of making excuses for myself

Now all the saints are dancing with the demons tonight
Welcome me home

Now you could find me with the finest hoes.
Choosin' which whip to drive by what match my clothes.

In a minute I'ma have the jeweler makin' my rims spin
My crew run wild at the Jamaica's at Kingston
Nothin' but bling bling in ya face boy
That's why my neck shine like one of them shirts Puffy and Mase wore
I done find a nympho as soon as I pop a bra
She had my balls head first just like a soccer star
You can only stand next to the man if you proper
Ya'll take care of birds like a animal doctor
Been out and I'm buzzin' niggas just slept on me
So I'm out for revenge like one of bin laden's cousins

Warren Barfield,Shadow,"I know my shady little shadow 
Would've left me long ago 
If he wasn't tied to my feet 
He's always been a scared one 
Turn off the lights and he runs 
Nowhere to be seen 

I am lonely only when I'm alone 

I need more than a shadow 
Someone that won't go 
Whenever life grows dark 
You're the only one I know 
Whose love never lets go 
We'll never be apart 
Never be apart 

You and me, we've got a good thing 
We move so smoothly 
You lead and I will follow 
You're closer than a brother 
I'm a book, You're the cover 
You surround my soul 

With You only my lonely is gone 

You're so much more than a shadow 
Someone that won't go 
Whenever life grows dark 
You're the only one I know 
Whose love never lets go 
We'll never be apart 

Never be apart

Dilated Peoples,Big Business,"(Rakaa Iriscience)
no questions
I pledge resistance to the grass
that hides the snakes of America
so they watch it, now I walk with caution
more careful put more thought to options
Is the opposite of progress Congress?
From the school to the street we're beyond stress
but I fight for peace, that's what the problem is
war is big biz, ask an economist
speak in volumes callin' anti-war and anti-American synonymous
Back in the day I would've gotten black listed just for speakin' up
Hoover probably would've screamed Communist!
I want black and brown unity
but cats get out to bring the jail to the community
Fightin's nothin' new to me
I even corrected what the public school system tried to do to me
Here's a spark encoded in rhyme and love for everyone of the devoted in line...
We call it art, some call it a crime
it's the rap Michael Moore, like Bowling for Columbine
on drums, Fahrenheit, 9-1-1
Al Queda hit the Apple and the world was stunned
the villain trained by the hero for the killing
now you twist $20 bills to see buildings
Under heavy surveillance
they might call you a traitor if you want something greater
Don't get me wrong, America's a great place to live
just listen to the knowledge I give
if more than half the budget goes to military spending
less than half goes to whatever it's defending
One nation, many gods, individuals with liberties
and justice for all who are miserable

Some do magic 
Some do harm 
I'm holding on, holding on 
I'm holding on to a straw 

Who is the Alpha
And what is made of cloth 
How do you say you're sorry and there's nothing 
to be afraid of? 

Is it dark already 
How light is a light 
Do you laugh while screaming 
Is it cold outside?

Autumnblaze,Her Golden Robe In Silence Veiled,"Shes standind here like carved in stone
In silence veiled, her withered cheek
A childhood queen without a throne
My dreamless sleeping child
Red sorrows grinning through my veins
My voice unheard, unseen the tears
Im waiting where the moonsun reigns
My garden whispers tunes
Hear my voice and drink my tears
I await you with firetunes
Veiled in everlasting silence
But once your heart was full of tunes
As we danced as one with the dryads of July
Ashra
Autumnal storms of endless grey
The harvester will sorrow reap
You saw the spring, the spring in May
Mein Feuerlilienstern
Hear my voice...

In Schlaf und Weltennacht versinken
Wenn ungehört verhallt mein Ruf
Will ich den Kelch des Todes trinken

Kris Kristofferson,Same Old Song,"I was just a young man
Working steady in a good time band
Pickin' every single little lick I could
Just to please the man
Harlan sang the lead for half
And we split up the rest
Hangin' on through the heavy times
And hopin' for the best

And I can't recall the names of all
Them places that we played in
All them squirrely party girls
And pills we used to pop
Hardly ever sleepin' in
Those cheap motels we stayed in
Hopin' we could take it 'til we'd make it to the top

Chorus:
And them nights, get a little bit brighter
And them bars just a little bit better
And the sweet, just a little bit sweeter
But them blues, well it's still the same old song

Now we're stars and shining on
Them prime time t.v. shows
Every stranger knows our name
And every little where we go
Findin' out the bottom ain't so different
>From the top
Just a few more friends that you'll be losin'
When you drop

And I've left some of my soul on
Every sweaty sheet that I could sleep on
Gettin' just as close to any body as I could
I don't regret a single bed I've laid my body down on
Ever since the first I had
The worst I had was good

And them nights, get a little bit brighter
And them bars just a little bit better
And the sweet, just a little bit sweeter

I was prey in your bed
And devoured completely

I get smothered in dispair, it's never over, over
Seems I'll never wake from this nightmare,

That it be over, over

Begging pleading no more

Each beat reminds me of you

And something warm to come to
When nights are cold and lonely.

that his life would turn into darkness
and alone he would face all demons
from his past that he tries to forget
An elder king warned of the dangers
that lie in the valleys of north and
his only change was to find his shadow
so he had to set forth

He is the man who travels in the land
of dragons and magic spells
He rides in the winds of fire and snow
and he rules the forest of elves

Slash of the golden sword
a flash in the burning night
Curse of the evil lord
He is fighting for his life for the last time

Oh such beauty in time, but it's just external
He cannot see the truth with his eyes, so he is bound by a lie

The snow starts falling in paradise, as he gazes at the stars
He will be born again in the sky, when the night turns into a dawn

On the way to the ancient castle of time
he will soon be damned by rage
so that his pride could betray him
when it's time to set him free
The tears in his mind had to be pushed aside
as he walked through the gates
He will never die

You're made in Japan from cheese and chalk
You're hippy type zeros 'cause you put on a bad show
You put on a bad show, oh, don't it show

Still out on those pills
Oh do you remember?

Think it's swell playing 
You're looking bored and you're acting flash
With nothing in your gut, to keep your mouth shut
You better keep your mouth shut, you're in a rut

Still out on those pills
Oh do the sambo

You're four years on, you still look the same
I think it's about time you changed you brain
You're just a pile of shit, you're coming to this
You poor little faggot, you're sealed with a kiss

Kiss me
Ha ha ha ha ha

Think it's swell playing in Japan
When everybody knows Japan is a dishpan
You're just a pile of shit, you're coming to this
You poor little faggot, you're sealed with a kiss

Still out on those pills 
Cheap thrills, , , anything
You're condemned to eternal bullshit
You're sealed with a kiss

Kiss me

A-looking for a kiss, you're coming to this

You do just about anything
Oh kiss this

Slaughtered in vain across the land
And how many struggles must there be

There was a boy who lay awake at night
Dreamin' what he would do with his life
What would it take to pay the rent in for that sunny day
That sunny day

I can't tell you what to do
You've got your dreams, I've got mine too
You can make it if you try
All I wanna say tonight is

""Follow your dreams and you will see
Anything you want you can achieve
Time to begin, fly like the wind
Breakin' down these walls you will be free""

Now that little boy is all grown up
So you see that the little boy was me
And I came here to let you know
That I found that sunny day
That sunny day

I can't tell you what to do
The dreams you hold will get you through
The power you need comes from within
Really know it's in your hands



Follow your dreams and you will see
Anything you want you can achieve
Time to begin, fly like the wind
Breakin' down these walls you will be free

I heard time and time again
How everybody's got a dream but they feel they won't win
'Cause somebody who was willin', who wanted to be chillin'
So they could never make it even if they were willin'
So we threw together this old school flow
So everybody in my generation oughta know
No matter what we take from this scene
Now you and me can follow our dreams

I can't tell you what to do
You've got your dreams, I've got mine too
You can make it if you try

I know that pain so don't you run away
Like you used to do

Roses in a vase of white
Bloodied by the thorns beside the leaves
That fall because my hand is
Pulling them hard as I can

You were always so far away
I know that pain
So I won't run away like I used to do

Pictures in a box at home
Yellowing and green with mold
So I can barely see your face
Wonder how that color taste

You were always so far away
I know the way so don't you run away

Heavens rejoice and the earth will exalt 
Oh no, come swing back like a catapult 
The sea and its fullness will roar 
He is our help and our shield our soul yearns for the lord 
Burning God of Yaacov everlasting stronghold 
Break down the door I can't hold back no more 
Wait all night long, until the early morning 
Like night watchmen wait for the dawning

Arise, be our help 
Place my trust in your kindness 
It's a must hoping in the God of deliverance 
Since way back when before time began 
Existing eternally, everlasting, rejoice in the name of his majesty so we sing 

Chorus 

Chant sweet melodies, utter hymns and sing praise to his name 
For he's alone exalted holy, 
Performing mighty deeds and making new things, 
Sowing righteousness and creating healing 
He spoke, the world came into being 
Master of praise, renews each day 
Redeems and saves, continuously, blessed is his name 
Making great lights, creating luminaries 
Abounding in mercy 
Won't you grant me?

To perceive, all the teachings in your Torah of love, existing eternally, lead me",happy,2004

She just ain't got what they got down in Biloxi
I got a doll in Pascadola I got a jewel in Gulf Port
And both of them more warm blooded that any woman I've made up north
And it's a cajun queen in Creole she must be six feet tall
When she starts lovin' now you just gonna climb up the wall
Ain't nothin' against the other states they just ain't got what they got down in Biloxi

When I reach the city limits I'm gonna stop upon the bluff
Nonchalantly get naked and go swimming in the gulf
Wash the north all off of me when I feel like it's done
I'm gonna crawl up on a rock and soak up all that southern sun
The sun shines in Minnesota but it don't shine like it do down in Biloxi

Skeletonwitch,Sacrifice for the Slaughtergod,"Stabbing hacking
Twisting the knife
Crushing killing
Reaping of life

Covered in remains
Reeking of death
Eyes of demon
Flesh of mortal man

Tearing the flesh
Annihilate the enemy
Bodies torn in half
Agonizing butchery
Dead now ablaze
Burning for the god's to see
Into the flame
Sacrifice humanity

Brutalized and pulverized
Blood pours from your soul

Stabbing hacking
Twisting the knife
Crushing killing
Reaping of life
Covered in entrails
Reeking of death
Eyes of a demon

Blood for the slaughtergod
Taking skulls that will build its throne
Massacre with no remorse
Rendering flesh from bone",sad,2007
Kix,Cold Blood (LP Version),"Cruisin' downtown
Shakin' her love
T and A talkin' to me
Felt my heart drop
Wheeled a dead stop
Girl has got me on my knees
Baby baby babe don't make me wonder
Won't you let me in
She said - see you later
Shot down
I'll be back again

Good love is all you need
But you don't wanna know
Cold blood is all you bleed
When it cools off - you tease it
When it gets hot - you freeze it
Cold blood is all you bleed

Dresses so tight
Moving to the beat
Set my feet on fire
Dream come true I want to give it to you
Let the flame get higher
Baby baby you're driving me crazy
Like a cat in a cage
You make me sh-sh-sh-shiver - earthquake
Down town to the blaze

Good love is all you need
Give me what I know
Cold blood is all you bleed
When it cools off - you tease it
When it gets hot - you freeze it
Cold blood is all you bleed

You make me so hot
I feel my temperature rise
Don't shoot me down - No

When it cools off - you tease it
When it gets hot - you freeze it
Cold blood is all you bleed

If I run, I can free my worried mind,
Yeah I know on the day I die I will lose my heavy load,
But I wouldn't want to leave you behind.

Now I've grown into a man,
But Mr. Child still wants to run,
From the cradle to the van, oh.

If I run, I can free my worried mind,
Keep thinking of the day I die when I lose my heavy load,
But I wouldn't want to leave you behind,
No I wouldn't want to leave you behind, hey, hey.

Oh, Keep thinking it'll be alright if I just get on the road,

I've lost my guardian angel –
A fleeting glimpse of your heart
Losing right from the start –
No return
And things will never be the same!

Tried to find the words that show I sympathise
Words of comfort, words that never critisize!
Though I know you're simply laughing at me
I just can't stop and simply let it be!

Where are all those feelings, all my yesterdays
Feelings, now I have bring back those bitter ways –
Though I know you wanna turn and blow
I just can't stop and simply let you go!

I feel I'm falling apart 'cos I know
I've lost my guardian angel –
A fleeting glimpse of your heart
Losing right from the start –
No return
And things will never be the same!

Warm as summer on a chilly winter's day –

Colin James,Sending A Message,"You're alone
You're inside
And the North Star is hanging above your home
It's so dark
And there is no sound
Except your heart beating away like a Morse code

Out it goes across the lake
The prairie grass lies down in waves
A thousand miles are gone when it comes through

You know that
I'm sending a message to you

Catching light as it goes by
Like comet trails streaking across the sky
And ride it down to anywhere you are

If I'm not right there next to you
And a word can't travel across the room
That anytime you're gone you're gone too far 

I, I'm sending a message out to you
I, I'm sending a message out to you

When you heat up the sound
Hold up your hands
The wave comes in at the edge of the land

Sending a message out to you
Sending a message, a message out to you

You smile
Because you feel it
Everything's starting to glow and you start to heal it

John Mayer,Something's Missing,"I'm not alone
I wish I was
Cause then I'd know I was down because
I couldn't find a friend around
To love me like they do right now
They do right now

I'm dizzy from the shopping mall
I searched for joy but I bought it all
It doesn't help the hunger pain
And a thirst I'd have to drown first to ever satiate

Something's missing
And I don't know how to fix it
Something's missing
And I don't know what it is
At all

When autumn comes
It doesn't ask
It just walks in where it left you last
You never know when it starts
Until there's fog inside the glass around your summer heart

Something's missing
And I don't know how to fix it
Something's missing
And I don't know what it is
At all

I can't be sure that this state of mine
Is not of my own design
I wish there was an over-the-counter test
For loneliness like this

Something's missing
And I don't know how to fix it
Something's missing
And I don't know what it is
No I don't know what it is

closed my eyes and couldn't see you
but everything about you is revealing

lock it up without the key

from you

and sometimes she puts the weight of the world on me
and she don't notice
sometimes she puts the weight of the world

for dead and bleeding

but your friends all said you went away
but I think I got it right today
thought that there's a chance that you might need me

well do you?

[Luda] Ay man let me ask you somethin man
[Luda] You ever have one of them days where you felt like
[Luda] you mighta got rid of all the bad seeds in your life?
[Luda] Y'knahmean like you just got your paycheck
[Luda] Paid off a car note or somethin
[Luda] Just jumped out the shower feelin fresh than a muh'fucka
[Luda] Witcha good shoes on, y'knahmtalkinbout?
[Quik] You mean like, paid off a Cadillac car note?
[Luda] Like a Cadillac, like you ready to throw a party
[Luda] Like call e'rybody you know, don't even plan it, just do it
[Quik] In Compton we call that spur of the moment
[Luda] Well let's do it, spur of the moment, whattup?

[Ludacris]
Well you can bring the drinks a little mo' my way
More I say, on another hot sunny Cali-for-nye day
Just touched down, called up my 8-1-8
fo' a date with some other bust downs
And I cruised up the block, car losed up the top
I take the breeze, quick break the trees
Feel good as we flippin through the Robb Repo't
My baby momma ain't trippin on child suppo't

[DJ Quik]
Well my baby momma is, because she see havin kids
as a tool for gettin chips, that's with or without the dip
She told my lawyer she's a nurse but she can't spell school
Quite frankly she's a motherfuckin fool, idiot
Welcome to the city where you might see thangs
Like real threats, fake breasts, negativity hangs
over the city like a puppet string, pullin you up
You think they love you 'til the director yells cut
Now they packin you with ice and zippin you up

[Chorus]
It's on tonight, get licked, get gone tonight
[KJ] And for once, in my life, everything's gonna be, alright
G'd up, my mind is freed up
[KJ] From the day, through the night, everything's gonna be, alright

Now on Arabian Spruce, Seagram's bumpy and juice
We used to bag and then truce, we used to sag and get loose
Not the kind of cats that's out to steal your bag and your jewels
But we check your medication just to see if you cool
You can't be dyin on us, after you live off of hemp
We party hard, like Ludacris Kim and Shock and them
We in that sunshine state where the bomb-ass hen be
And hemp be the beats we flip thee and we pimps thee simply

[Ludacris]
So stay with me, and let's get tipsy
Rememberin the days on the block sippin whiskey
Runnin 'round grinnin, runnin 'round sinnin
Gettin lit, then I wonder why my head kept spinnin
But I'm all grown up now, less throwin up now
Record blowed up, so my hood throwed up
Now let's break loose cause your boy's around
And tonight we gon' celebrate bein alive, riiiiight

[Chorus]

[Ludacris]
It's just one of those days, without a care in the world
You ain't gotta look mean, I know you care for your girl
But she's lookin this way and I'm gonna come get her
Fresh haircut, so I'm feelin quite kipper
Can't nothin go wrong cause my strap's on my back
And if fools wanna scrap then my tool will attack
But forget the click-clack, ain't no need for the steel
Just a straight house party and some meat on the grill

[DJ Quik]
Now if it's Los Angeles, watch a boss handle biz
I'ma put this on my kids, stupid it's an outfit
If you ain't been around the world keep yo' mouth zipped
Or you'll be wonderin where yo' house went
You see I'm not normal and I'm not a homo
I'm mo' apt to shoot a porno with you in cornrows
And call it ""More Hoes: Volume 5, Volume 6""
And show 'em in the back of my truck, at the FreakNic
Trick, what'chu workin with?

In a session with me lightin' up a little herbal
Turtle shell

Word it well
Given to the rapper who is livin to be heard and held
In a high esteem
I get you drunker than your bourbon, ale, liquor, malt, my assault learned it well
Turn the tables of time with my perception
Building staples of rhyme hear my reflections
""on a little"" life I'm livin in a universe with no beginning to it
So it ain't an ending and at times I get to diggin into infinite subliminably spirited
A nigga with a ""clip and send it rip         ""

Rappers organizations get shut down
Not that I don't wanna see my brothers succeed
But rap its like a sport, I dominate, so follow my lead

Cruise like a jet ski
Up in yo apartment and plop on your couch y'all

At times when I'm ""  "" they shine you remember
""  "" divine forces ""  "" that refine men & women &

That isn't what it's all about, really now, valid clout
Uzi mc's I have arguments n' fallin' outs wit'
About what it's all about, ain't about foamin out the mouth
Like a walkin tall can of Guinness Stout
""        ""
When the battle cries soundin'
Ding-ding, hit 'em like, bing-bing
Eat 'em like, B-King, yet wit' no seasoning-bee sting
Wich yo girl dressed in a g-string she's swingin'
My way shorty and it sure looks good
I'm cookin up a batch of dopeness like a good cook should
I be the jack of trades, rappers pray
That I don't decapitate, after they cash his ass
Is that an irate? Great!
Grade-A, top-choice lyricism
Hey, hit me wit' that shell shocked rhythm
One time fo' the funky rhymes I say
Two times for the beat and for my DJ
It don't stop

I say we drop it on a (one), we drop it on a (two)
We comin' out (fresh), and we do it (for you)
You know the deal with Blackalicious, we don't play

You know we leave the party wreakin' a disaster
For the new ""millie"", rain like a shower
Let it seep in your pores (??)
Oh lord that's [scratch]
Rock ya from the top and to the bottom (from the bottom to the top)
(cause I grab the mic) wit the intent to get ill
A natural that you know who is (still Mrs. Field's)
So slide to the side and (take it light) and (throw your hands in the air) all night (party people in the place...)
I make 'em suffer, to the fallen mc's I'd be the (quicker pickem upper) (galactic of a nebula)
I'm rappin the spectacular, attackin whack amateurs n' back stabbin salamanders
Creepin while I'm peepin on 'em (party time)
Before I used to hit the meetings it was (Thunderbird wine) (used to drink the Ole)

But the world is still gettin colder (colder)

It lifts my spirit up
It makes me carry on when I don't have the strength

You give me light to see

Catch me 'cause I'm falling, I'm so lost inside your love
Can you hear me calling to your heart?
'Cause you're the one, the reason I go on

Could I find the words to tell you how I feel
With one look from your eyes?
I know what heaven's worth so I'd sell everything
To hold and touch you

You're the air I breath
The reason my heart beats

Catch me 'cause I'm falling, I'm so lost inside your love

In an attempt to get my groove on I offered you my white castle coupon

The radio was playing seal, I tried to tell you how I feel
But then our shopping carts locked wheels and the moment just seemed wrong

Lives an old man and his shadow
And they're whistling day and night
For whatever, whatever it's worth for
They are whistling for you and I

On a ranch in the wildness
There's a song that must be sung
About a blindfolded angel 
Who never learned the right from wrong
And though I don't know enough English
To describe its troubled mind
But for one thing I am certain 
Is that it sings for you and I

And I tried so hard to figure him out 
But I guess I'm only human
I've been watching him, drawing him
Analyzing him in every way
I could possibly think of

But that does not really help me
You gotta sit back and enjoy
You know Ochrasy raised and betrayed him
Now he sits there all alone
With his soul and his legend
And his epic melodies

And they are with us when we bleed

Lying on my back, wheeled under blinding light
Shackled restraints resist my attempted fight
The scalpels hovers over me, the incision is made
Once again they're watching me, no new sensation, just frustration 

They said it was for science
But I'm the human guinea pig
The guinea pig
The guinea pig
The guinea pig
The guinea pig
The guinea pig

My sleep has been altered, I open my eyes
The nightmare continues, I see through their lies
The papers keep turning, the tests never ends
Once again they're watching me, no new sensation, just frustration

They said it was for science
But I feel like the human guinea pig

Time may have passed on, but I won't soon forget
The old sensation, pure frustration of a human guinea, guinea pig",sad,1987

So sublime that we blow my mind

In the waterfall I just wanna play

And you took my hand and you stole my heart away

Novembre,Triesteitaliana,"There at the borders
Cold and rigid guardians dressed of no life

We run and run in circles
Till the world stops spinning round
(Run in circles, and the world as we know it, spins in silence)

Till remaining breathless, panting
Overwhelmed by laughter

Starry skies of stains
Ultimately sorry
Uneducated random strokes of pain

It's a chain going backwards through the veins
Must sew up this wound and run away

I can feel their strenght
Through crooked-lightning desert pathways

Run and run and run the pathways
branching off through time
Two lone-wolves shared
the utmost silence of the time
(run, run the pathways as you share
the uttermost of silence)

I stood up and started moving with a childlike fascination
For those doors that don't have locks and the stairways that were blocked
So I dug through the obstruction, put my fist around the railing

And each step was far apart and far away from steps before it
And the air was getting thinner 'til I couldn't breathe at all
And if I happened to look behind me there were miles and miles of stairs
Enough so I couldn't see the doorway but I knew that it was there

And on the last step I was dizzy 'cause there were stairs in all directions
But I found another door and through the door there was the attic
Without old clothes, without a ceiling, everything had opened wide
Into the jaws of something bigger and suddenly I saw that I was

Upstairs and outside and
Freezing on the roof
Finally it had found me
The answer, the feeling and the truth

That I'm small

That I'm small
I'm smaller than the smallest fireball",happy,2007

Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall 
For chance to be with you I'd gladly risk it all 
Through the fire, through whatever come my way 
For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way... 
Right down to the wire, even through the fire 

I really apologize how I sound right now man 
This ain't fair at all man 
They got my mouth wired shut for like I don't know the doctor said for like six weeks 
You know we had reconstru.... 
I had reconstructive surgery on my jaw 
Looked in the mirror half my jaw was missing and half my mouth 
I couldn't believe it 
But I'm still here for y'all right now yo 
This is what I gotta say yo 
Yeah, turn me up yeah 

(Verse 2) 
What if somebody from the Chi-town was ill got a deal on the hottest rap label around 
But he wasn't talking bout coke and birds it was more like spoken word 
Except he really putting it down 
And he explained the story about how blacks came from glory 
And what we need to do in the game 
Good dude, Bad night, Right place, Wrong time 
In the blink of an eye his whole life changed 
If you could feel how my face felt you would know how Mase felt 
Thank God I ain't to cool for the safe belt 
I swear to God driver two on the sue 
I got lawyer for the case to keep my safe book safe 
My dawgs couldn't tell if I 
I look like Tom Cruise on Vanilla Sky 
it was televised 
There's been an accident like GEICO 
They thought I was burnt up like Pepsi did Michael 
I must gotta angel 
Cause look how death missed his ass 
Unbreakable, would you thought they called me Mr. Glass 
Look back on my life like the ghost of Christmas past 
Toys R Us where I used to spend that Christmas cash 
And I still wont grow up, I'm a grown ass kid 
Swear I should be locked up for stupid shit that I did 
But I'm a champion, so I turned tragedy to triumph 
Make music that's fire, spit my soul through the wire

For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way... 
Right down to the wire, even through the fire 

Know what I'm saying 
When the doctor told me I had a um.. I was goin' to have a plate on my chin 
I said dawg didn't you realize I'll never make it on the plane now 
It's bad I got all this jewelry on 
Can't be serious man",happy,2003
Lloyd Banks,South Side Story,"Yeh Yeh Yeh
I done learned from mistakes like who's my man
N' Who's not, like who's gon run and who's not
Like who's gon shoot if you shot
Who gon hold they own, who's not
Who gon change glocks

[Chorus x2]

In the street of new york you can't trust nobody
Niggas'll run up on you with a 12 gauge shoty
Loyalty comes free and smokin' weed is my hobby
You wanna rob me you gotta leave here with a body

[Verse 1: Lloyd Banks]

When I was 10 years old I seen a nigga take 3 in the head
Probably around the same time you use to pee in the bed
I'd stay awake cause my nightmares was seein' him dead
The smell of burnt tires peelin after leavin him lead
The killer fled with a fuckin laugh
My heart pumpin on blast
I just stare at him slumped in the grass
Arms movin, fingers shakin, spittin up blood
DNA mixed in the mud, another ditch to be dug
Their I stood stiffer than wood it's the homie that use to buy me candy
Now he's gone who's gonna provide his family
My air bring this shit up n' runnin I never thought I'd be that sick
Damn I wasn't suppose to see that shit
That's when I thought, it was more than 3 shots
It could have been the aimin for me, maybe he circled around the block
I turned around and my pops, he like 'what happened?'
This nigga rolled up and just started clappin', I can still hear him laughin'

[Chorus x2]
In the street of new york you can't trust nobody
Niggas'll run up on you with a 12 gauge shoty
Loyalty comes free and smokin' weed is my hobby
You wanna rob me you gotta leave here with a body

[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]

It was a regular day in southside, sprinklers n' kids runnin'
And all of a sudden heads turnin', somebody did sumthin
This nigga named, I forgot, fuck it he lived around the block
Regular getting' money nigga but loved to clown a lot
Walk across the park stuntin' and frontin'
Diamonds in his ears, diamond watch on, eatin a bag of popcorn
Walked up behind a shorty and grabbin' her waist
She pushed him away
So he threw the bag in her face
She felt disrespected , shorty couldn't accept it
Called him a pussy told him she'd be back in a second
But he ain't payin no mind called her a bitch about 4 times
Stayed in the park, with no niggas with him and no nine
And then in no time an older nigga from behind
Swung a baseball bat
Left his face all crack
Told him to take all that
Hit him again popped his chain with a frown
And left the clown with a stain on the ground

[Chorus x2]
In the street of new york you can't trust nobody
Niggas'll run up on you with a 12 gauge shoty
Loyalty comes free and smokin' weed is my hobby
You wanna rob me you gotta leave here with a body

[Verse 3: Lloyd Banks]

Now all my days go by blowin that sicky icky
California made me picky
Chickenheads tryin' to stick me with a hicky
If we, roll up quickly, stick me, some was tipsy
The location don't matter I'm southside until they hit me
I'd be dead
If looks can kill, I'm from the ghetto boys
But I don't know scarface or Bushwick Bill, My heart spills
For the kids who ain't got nothing and who got to steal, and from my
Cousin I lost, lookd over the steerin wheel

[Chorus x2]
In the street of new york you can't trust nobody
Niggas'll run up on you with a 12 gauge shoty

Sister Hazel,Space Between Us (Album Version),"Took a left turn at Albuquerque
You went north and I went south
It's just time so don't you worry, Hard to wait but patience pays

Open my door the cupboard's bare
It's hard to give when nothing's there
All this shit and such confusion, Tell myself it's not an illusion

We need some space between us
Take a deep breath, Clear my head
We need some space between us
Fall the wall, And build a bridge
We need some space between us
Don't go out and get a New thing
Hey - Hey - Hey 

I've been here it's so familiar, Close the book I know the end
Want so much a different story, Want so much a different way 

Just so much well its just so much
And I'm up too close and I just can't see
Tryin' to think before I answer
And I'm trying' to walk before I run

Kris Kristofferson,Darby's Castle,"See the ruin on the hill
Where the smoke is hanging still
Like an echo of an age long forgotten.
There's a story of a home
Crushed beneath those blackened stones
And a roof that fell before the beams were rotten.
See, Saul Darby loved his wife
And he laboured all his life
To provide her with material possessions
And he built for her a home
Of the finest wood and stone
And the building soon became his sole obsession.

Oh it took three hundred days
For the timber to be raised
And the silhouette was seen for miles around
And the gables reached as high
As the eagles in the sky
But it only took one night to bring it down --
When Darby's castle tumbled to the ground.

Though the shared a common bed
There was precious little said
In the moments that were set aside for sleeping.
For his busy dreams were filled
With the rooms he'd yet to build
And he never heard young Helen Darby weeping.
Then one night he heard a sound
As he laid his pencil down
And he traced it to her door and turned the handle,
And the pale light of the moon, 
Through the windows of the room,
Split the shadows where two bodies lay entangled.

Oh it took three hundred days
For the timber to be raised
And the silhouette was seen for miles around
And the gables reached as high
As the eagles in the sky
But it only took one night to bring it down --
When Darby's castle tumbled to the ground.",sad,1970
Bad Religion,Doing Time (Album Version),"See the fight
Old men crying, deny their ruin
Watch them try
The cynic laughs at the optimist's closed eyes

Darkness falls, curtain calls, the cynic's beer soon overflows
Other watches, has a seat, and from the same cup, they drink
I'm doing time, how long I don't know

William had 26
Blew his brains out, now look at him
John had only one
Watch the mother mourn her only son

I'm doing time, how long I don't know
I'll kiss goodbye my brain and body
And go to sleep for generations (2x)

Salvation
Cease concentration
You'll only lose the fight
Don't tell me what's wrong or right
You're losing sight
You're just gonna die anyway",sad,1982
Shawn Colvin,Sunny Came Home,"Sunny came home to her favorite room
Sunny sat down in the kitchen
She opened a book and a box of tools
Sunny came home with a mission

She says ""Days go by, I'm hypnotized
I'm walking on a wire
I close my eyes and fly out of my mind
Into the fire""

Sunny came home with a list of names
She didn't believe in transcendence
And it's time for a few small repairs, she said
Sunny came home with a vengeance

She says ""Days go by, I don't know why 
I'm walking on a wire
I close my eyes and fly out of my mind
Into the fire""

Get the kids and bring a sweater
Dry is good and wind is better
Count the years, you always knew it
Strike a match, go on and do it

Oh, days go by, I'm hypnotized
I'm walking on a wire
I close my eyes and fly out of my mind

Oh, light the sky and hold on tight

And where is the voice of yesterday's cries
Take me away from all your lies.

Whispering words to spite my passion

Just like the rest
It's easy to see I am the one you attest
Oh this awful life has a change as the hours
As you pass before my eyes

Now that you've come back to me
You give yourself,
That's all that I need.

Like some old tumbleweed, my thoughts go tumblin' back home
In memories I recall those simpler times
And a way of life I never left behind

Down at the old corral
Just sittin', watchin' the sun go down
Oh, how I'm wishin' that I could be there now
Down at the old corral

I remember everything I ever heard
Like how to judge a man's true worth, by how he keeps his word
That saddle wisdom never seemed to end
Everything I need to know I learned back then

Oh, how I'm wishin' that I could be there now

Above my head

Burned my eyes

To eat like a king, to poke fun at clergy
To talk like dirt
To love yo like tar
But never fall in too fast
With my north star
While you pull your hair out
I buy the drinks at the bar

Ridin with my strap on, foot on the pedal
Them silly beef raps, now they on another level, level

Throw that pack nigga, toss that trigger

Can he see or is he blind?
Can he walk at all,
Or if he moves will he fall?
Is he alive or dead?
Has he thoughts within his head?
We'll just pass him there
Why should we even care?

He was turned to steel
In the great magnetic field
When he traveled time
For the future of mankind

Now the time is here
For Iron Man to spread fear
Vengeance from the grave
Kills the people he once saved

Nobody wants him
He just stares at the world
Planning his vengeance
That he will soon unfurl

Nobody wants him
They just turn their heads
Nobody helps him
Now he has his revenge

Fills his victims full of dread
Running as fast as they can

Just one look at you, my heart grew tipsy in me.
You and you alone bring out the gypsy in me.
I love all
The many charms about you;
Above all,
I want my arms about you.
Don't be a naughty baby,
Come to mama, come to mama, do!
My sweet embraceable you.

Silverchair,Suicidal Dream,"I dream about, how it's gonna end
Approaching me quickly
Living a life of fear
I only want my mind to be clear

People, making fun of me
For no reason but jealousy
I fantasize about my death
I'll kill myself, from holding my breath

My suicidal dream
Voices telling me what to do
My, suicidal dream
I'm sure you will get yours too

Help me, comfort me
Stop me from feeling what I'm feeling now
The rope is here, now I'll find a use
I'll kill myself, I'll put my head in a noose

My suicidal dream
Voices telling me what to do
My, suicidal dream
I'm sure you will get yours too

Dreamin' about my death, dream

In New York I found a friend to drown out the other voices
Voices on the cell phone
Voices from home
Voices of the hard sell
Voices down the stairwell
In New York, just got a place in New York

In New York summers get hot, well into the hundreds
You can't walk around the block without a change of clothing
Hot as a hairdryer in your face
Hot as a handbag and a can of mace
In New York, I just got a place in New York
New York, New York

In New York you can forget, forget how to sit still
Tell yourself you will stay in
But it's down to Alphaville

New York, New York, New York
New York, New York, New York

The Irish have been coming here for years
Feel like they own the place
They got the airport, city hall, concrete, asphalt, they even got the police
Irish, Italian, Jews and Hispanics
Religious nuts, political fanatics in the stew,
Living happily not like me and you
That's where I lost you... NewYork

New York, New York
New York, New York

In New York I lost it all to you and your vices
Still I'm staying on to figure out my mid life crisis
I hit an iceberg in my life
But you know I'm still afloat
You lose your balance, lose your wife
In the queue for the lifeboat

You got to put the women and children first
But you've got an unquenchable thirst for New York

New York, New York
New York, New York

In the stillness of the evening
When the sun has had its day
I heard your voice a-whispering
Come away child

Coven,Coven In Charing Cross,"Thirteen cultists
Held a secret meeting,
Bringing powers of the darkness
Upon those who opposed them.
The cheif of the circle,
Known as Malchius
drank the blood of a young baby
Offered unto him.

They danced ecstatically,
The orgied frantically.
The demon had arisen
From the circle on the floor.
The chanting was much louder
And more piercing than before.

They are seven.
They are seven.
Seven are they.
Out of the abyss they rise,
When day sinks into darkness.
Seven are they.

Coven in charing cross...
Coven in charing cross...

Soon, a certain family
Living in the village,
Would die one by one by
The curse of the cult.
The head of the family,
A witchhunter named Mead,
had burned their leadser at the stake;
Soon he'd regret his deed.

Pain from Devil's we evoke!
Thirst and suffer til he'd choked.
The magic did take over
And the soul did feel the roar.
Incantations were much louder
And more piercing than before.

Born in the bowels of the hills
Evil ones, sources of ills.
Setters of unseen snares,
Death to all pity, all prayers.
Male they are not.
Female they are not.
No wives have they known.
No children begot.
The fiends they are seven,
Disturbers of heaven.
They are seven.
They are seven.
Seven they are.

Dead Prez,Be Healthy,"It's all love.

I don't eat no meat.
No dairy, no sweets.
Only ripe vegtables, fresh fruit and whole wheat.
I'm from the old school, my household smells like soul food, bro.
Curry falafel, barbequed tofu.
No fish, or none of dem candy bars.
No ciggarettes.
Only ganja, and fresh squeezed juice from oranges.
Excerisin' daily,  to stay healthy.
An I rarely drink water out the tap cause it's filthy.

Lentil soup - is- mental fruit
and, ginger root- is good for the youth.
Fresh vegetables with the ital stew.
Sweet yam fries with the green caleoo
Careful how you season and prepare your foods,
cause you dont want to loose - vitamins and minerals 
and that's the jewel-
Life brings.
Life is valuable , so I eat what comes from the ground- It's natural.
Let your food be your medicine. No exceteran.
Strictly herb, generates from the sun.
Cause I got MELANIN.
Drink water. 8 glasses a day.
Cause that's what they say.

They say you are what you eat.
So I strive to eat healthy .
My goal in life is not to be rich or wealthy.
Cause true wealth, comes from good health and wise ways.
That's why we gotta start takin better care of ourselves.

Be Healthy Ya'll.

Take a little tip from the tabloid
Because I know I'm not paranoid
When I say I saw ya tryin' to mock me
Now you and your crew are on a mission tryin' to hawk me
But it isn't happenin' ya fraudulent foes
You used to front big time now I suppose
That everything's cool since the style of apparel you adopted
You used to make fun of but now you wanna rock it

Took a little time before the D-E-L could see through

And my man responded they would bomb a
Fraudulent foe with the strength of Hercules
The way ya on my dick must really hurt ya knees

Ever since I did a little show in Guadeloupee
I neva saw a groupie like you
But what is funny is ya wanted to be down with my crew
But D-E-L is not down with any clowns or jesters
So I would suggest that ya try to impress Uncle Fester

Best believe we gone forever
Don't be the reason
Don't be the reason
You better learn how to treat us right
'Cause once a good girl goes bad
We die forever

He steady with a flock of 'em, oh yeah
Got a girl at home but he don't care
Won't care (won't care), all you do is keep me at home
Won't let me go nowhere
He thinks because I'm at home
I won't be gettin' it on
And now I'm finding numbers
In the jacket pockets
Chicks calling the house non-stop
It's getting out of control
Finally I can't take no more
He finds a letter on the stairs
Saying this is the end
I packed my bag and left with your best friend

Easy for a good girl to go bad
And once we gone
Best believe we gone forever
Don't be the reason
Don't be the reason
You better learn how to treat us right
'Cause once a good girl goes bad
We die forever

We stay moving around solo
Ask us where you at, we don't know
And don't care (don't care)
All we know is we was at home 'cause you left us there
You got your boys and got gone and left us all alone

Easy for a good girl to go bad
And once we gone
Best believe we gone forever
Don't be the reason
Don't be the reason
You better learn how to treat us right
'Cause once a good girl goes bad
We die forever

We gone forever
We gone forever",happy,2007
Britney Spears,Everytime,"Notice me, take my hand 
Why are we strangers when 
Our love is strong 
Why carry on without me 

Everytime I try to fly, I fall 
Without my wings, I feel so small 
I guess I need you, baby 
And everytime I see you in my dreams 
I see your face, it's haunting me 
I guess I need you, baby 

I make believe that you are here 
It's the only way I see clear 
What have I done 
You seem to move on easy 

And everytime I try to fly, I fall 
Without my wings, I feel so small 
I guess I need you, baby 
And everytime I see you in my dreams 
I see your face, you're haunting me 
I guess I need you, baby 

I may have made it rain 
Please forgive me 
My weakness caused you pain 
And this song's my sorry 

At night I pray 
That soon your face will fade away 

And everytime I try to fly, I fall 
Without my wings, I feel so small 
I guess I need you, baby 
And everytime I see you in my dreams 
I see your face, you're haunting me

Rise Against,State Of The Union,"If we're the flagship of peace and prosperity
We're taking on water and about to fuckin' sink
No one seems to notice, no one even blinks
The crew all left the passengers to die under the sea

Countdown, to the very end
Equality, an invitation that we won't extend
Ready aim, pull the trigger now
In time you firmly secure your place in hell

State of the union address
Reads war torn country still a mess
The words: power, death, and distorted truth
Are read between the lines of the red, white, and blue

Ready aim, pull the trigger now

Destruction might assume charge or feed belief

Shaman,For Tomorrow (live),"Long ago, the world was one
We walked through the ice floes
To an unenduring land
Our future, our hope
There was something in the air,
The Age of the Unknown
Far beyond the sea of trees
The vision laid close

There's a place where the sun shines brighter
There's a mountain that climbs to the stars...

Day and night we built a reign
With heavenly desire
Sweat and dreams made up the bricks
That raised up our walls

Paying tribute to the gods
And blood kept on flowing
And the lust for knowledge
Was the sense of it all

Fly, fly to the stars,
Reach them on high
Bring back the answers of the night
Roll with the clouds,
Sing with the birds,
'Cos one day we'll have to say goodbye!

Here we go, carrying no longer sorrow
Standing up in the wind
Walk along, marching on for tomorrow
In this neverending way

Many years of harmony
The message arrived soon
Three big stars lined up together
A chill in the air...

The high-priest was dressed in black
On top of the stairways
Longing for the sacrifice
Of those who would dare

Fly, fly to the stars
Then let it fall
Into the emptiness of night
Our time has come
Time to move on
'Cos one day we have to say goodbye...

Here we go, carrying no longer sorrow
Standing up in the wind
Walk along, marching on for tomorrow
In this neverending way

Come with me to Paradise
Let's return again,
Let's return again!

To be closer to the skies
Living on a dream,
Living on a dream...

Here we go, carrying no longer sorrow
Standing up in the wind
Walk along, marching on for tomorrow
In this neverending way",happy,2003

I just wanna say Happy Valentine's Day!

Can y'all dig that?

Cupid grabs the pistol 
He shoots straight for your heart
And he won't miss you
That's alright y'all won't believe in me anyway but,

Ya won't believe in me but you would fancy leprechauns or ground hogs,
No thank you, Easter Bunny!
There's all this talk about Santa Claus, 
But see love will rule supreme

Happy Valentine's Day!
Every day the 14th!
When cupid knocks at your door,
You can't ignore me (there's no need to run!)
Happy Valentine's Day!
Every day the 14th!
If you know what love means 
Somebody tell me!

Ya won't believe in me but you would fancy leprechauns or ground hogs,
No thank you, Easter Bunny!
There's so much fuss about Santa Claus
But see cupid will not be defeated!

Happy Valentine's Day!
Every day the 14th!
Now I know your hearts have grown cold, and that bothers me
Now I understand 'cause I used to be a bad boy in my day
I know your tryin' to protect your lil' feelings
But you can't run away! (Uh oh!)

Ya won't believe in me but you would fancy,
Hey don't you suppose to be some kind of player or somethin'... 
Bunny!!
Well keep on runnin', player cause I got my good shoes on 
And I got 'em tied up tight, so your gon' find out tonight!

Got a sweet lil' darling back in my corner
Below I know I love her but, act like I don't want her
Surrounded by the lovely but yet feel like a loner
Could be an organ donor
The way I'd give up my heart 
But never know because shit I never tell her
Ask me how I'm feeling I'd holla that it's irrel'
I don't get myself caught in the jello jella, 
And pudding pops that other opt to call falling in love but
For the record have you ever rode a horse?
Likely you just sent me to Pluto, I said of course
But if you ain't a sweety indeedy I won't endorse
Han Solo till I'm hit by bullets, obey the force
Bewitch you, and I rich you in better time permits
For now show me samples, examples why you're the shit
But how am I to know with the profession that I'm in
And if you do not know me then how could you be my friend?

Randy Travis,Wind In The Wire (Album Version),"I've been riding fence all day,
Way up on the summer range.
Found a place to make my bed
As the evening shadows spread
Beyond the campfire light,
In the stillness of night,
Came the call of a coyote choir,
And the song
Of the wind in the wire.

As it strummed the rusted strings,
It sang of long-forgotten things.
Many moons and many suns
Of the real Americans.
When the arrow and the bow
Stalked the range
Of the buffalo,
And the call of the coyote choir
Knew no song
Of the wind in the wire.

As the ghostly balladeer
Hypnotized me, I could hear
Bugle calls, and battle cries.
Broken promises and lies.
The spirits of the plain
Still sing their sad refrain
In the call of the coyote choir
And the song
Of the wind in the wire.",sad,1993

Love can break your heart
So give it all you can give

So it's gotta be worth it to me
It's gotta be worth it to you

I know we can read all the signs
But after all only time's gonna tell

Girl, I'm not afraid to take a chance

Fun Lovin' Criminals,Love Unlimited (Explicit),"Chorus:
Barry White, saved my life
And if Barry White, saved your life
Or got you back with your ex-wife
Sing Barry White, Barry White, it's alright.


Now I was watching Banachek
My mind's eye
right back when i was a seed
and learning 'bout life
At night they came together and gave me sight
He said it's better doing this, than sucking on a pipe
Now when she came over, she brought the discus
On and on, she promised to kick this
EWF, stole my breath
When he finished, there was nothing left


Chorus.


Over and over, 'til it's ready
Sing about it low and fat like J. P. Ghetti
We make it happen, ass slappin'
Sitting on the point to where you never catch us nappin'
CO efino, he got the money grips
No parking for Saturday night and the pips
The pips know the hymns, they singing along
Like knowing the verbs is gonna keep you from the twilight
Ummmmm Do a little like that


Barry White, Barry White, You know it's alright

Bring forth the energy. Turbocharger. Fight, conquer

Let me tell you from the start I know it now by heart

And if your heart is breaking think how I must feel

And leave you without a trace.

The youth them getting restless and they don't want you near. 
Your watching us your watching us it so improper 
We've seen your kind before we call it informer.

This world she no like you so you better stay low. 
And up from the mountains and out from the trees, 
That is where you come from you crawl like the one disease.

So now you pass me the laser beam 
And you want me to join the team. 
Well Im not used to these kinds of things, 
But this is what the evil brings. 
Let me tell you bout the fire. 
You could bring the waters up above. 
I'll bring my favorite people and I'm bringing all my love. 
You want a battle well don't look very far, 
You want to fight somebody come fight the superstar. 
I knew you wouldn't stand a chance you left without a passing glance, 
There's nothing you could ever do to keep me from stopping you

(verse 3:) 
It's so dark and lonely out here in outer space, 
But at least I got my keyboard and my low bot has his bass.
Playing street sweeper tunes and watching TIE fighters fly by.

Burning pakalolo not even noticing the weather 
So far and so alone a million light years away.

I got my blaster set I'm ready to start a minor war.

Better run now cause your done now cause your standing in a bad mans town, boy. 
Time to get back to my daily routine have a beer at a bar on Tattooine.

Just bring it back 
Lord just bring it back. 
You mess it up and you rearrange open your eyes and turn the page.

Bob Carlisle,Man Of No Reputation,"It was said this man was of no reputation
Yet He could stop the rising storm
With a gesture of His hand
But He chose to use His hands to heal
Hearts of darkness, hearts of stone
Just like mine would be revealed

He was a man of no reputation
And by the wise, considered a fool
When He spoke about faith and forgiveness
In a time when the strongest arms ruled

But this man of no reputation
Loved the weak with relentless affection
And He loved all those poor in spirit just as they were
He was a man of no reputation

It was said this man brought only confusion
That He'd achieve his ends by any means
And the truth that it brings revolution
And for once they were right
The truth set us free

The hearts of the captive were his only concern
And the powerful knew their days were ending

He was a man of no reputation
And by the wise, considered a fool
When He spoke about faith and forgiveness
In a time when the strongest arms ruled

But this man of no reputation
Loved the weak with relentless affection
And He loved all those poor in spirit just as they were
He was a man of no reputation

One day soon the gates of heaven will open wide
And the Prince of Peace will come back for His bride
But for now we live on these streets
Forbidding and tough

Where push always comes to shove
And it's said love's never enough
Where a prophet in rags gives hope to a fearful world
No injustice, no heart of darkness
Will keep this voice from being heard

He was a man of no reputation
And by the wise, considered a fool
When He spoke about faith and forgiveness
In a time when the strongest arms ruled

But this man of no reputation
Loves us all with relentless affection
And He loves all those poor in spirit, come as you are
To the man of no reputation",sad,1994

So they probaly told you go with the flow
Just so that I don't explode
And have another episode where I let it go as far as
The one with Benzino did

I'm cocked, locked and loaded
I'm ready to go so bad I'm goin bananas
My dick's so hard Anna Nicole could use it
To fuckin' pole vault with
Oh shit, I mean when she was still bloated 
Before they cut her stomach open and lipoed it

Anybody I throw flames at gets a name it's a game
Cause they know that they don't spit the same
It's a shame, what people do for 10 minutes of fame
Everyday it's the same thing
People in this game try to buddy buddy us
Just to get close enough to study us
Everybody just wants to have somethin to do with that
They all tryin' to get that stamp
They after that Shady/Aftermath money

It's like a monopoly
They probaly just now finally understand how to rob fully

And Dre, it's like we hit the fuckin lottery

And a damn slot machine at the same time as each other

When we rhyme with each other 
In time we discovered that we had more in common 
Then we thought with each other

Both robbed of our mothers
Our fathers ain't want us
What was wrong with us, was it our fault
Cause we started thinkin God doesn't love us
Two hard motheruckers who just happened to meet at the right time
What a coincidence cause when 50 got shot up in Jamaica Queens
I still remember the call up in chunking cause

Big L had just got popped just a month before
If 50 lives he's gettin dropped from Columbia
Two years later me and Doc had to come and operate
That's when he popped up a number one
And we ain't never gonna stop if you wonderin
Even if I'm under the gun 

You ain't gotta agree all the time with me
Or see eye to eye there'll always be animosity between you and I
But see the difference is if it is I could give a shit 
Still gonna conduct motherfuckin buisness as usual

Ego's aside, fore I bruise em' all 
Swallow your pride fore I step on it with shoes you call Nike's
Earth links how do you like these you gotta love them
Look at the bottom of em' they're like cleats
Stompin, I been rompin since Tim Dogg was hollerin
'Fuck Compton'

I wasn't even raps Elvis yet

It wasn't my fault
You rolled me over, flipped me over
Like a somersault.

But I saw forever in my never
And I stood outside her heaven

Will you wait for me in time?
It's never my luck so never mind

I tend to push them till the pushing's turned from hurt into burn
I always take them to that place they thought they wanted to go

I can try to be with you, but somehow I'll end up just losing a friend
I can only reach for you, relate to you, I'm losing my friend
Where did she go? Where?

I had a dream that you were with me
It wasn't my fault
You rolled me over, flipped me over
Like a somersault
That doesn't happen to me
I've never been here before
I saw forever in my never
And I stood outside her heaven
I stood outside her heaven

Would you let me in your heaven?
I wanna live inside your heaven",sad,2009

It's got strip malls and bus stops and people 
I would never really talk to
And she says life could be sweet
But life is so cruel 'cause I let it be

They wanna live somewhere else
I wish I could find a place
And stay there by myself
And bit by bit I swear I think I'm losing

I can feel
the poisons that you breathe are real

You can change reality that you sustain
You concede
To anything that you believe

Please don’t leave me words to cope with
Painted lies on walls of hope and
Wasted days for us to grieve
There is more to this
Than you believe

I can see
The end of this inevitably
Stay right here
Inverted and away from fear

You maintain the emptiness that I contain
You are free
Please be what you can choose to be

Throw away your words of greed
Hold onto the things you need
Perfect days and sympathy
Or dreams inside your ""happy sea""",sad,2007

Nevermind these things at all, it's nothing.
Couldn't find a way to you, seems that's all I ever do.
Turning up in black and blue, rewarded.

All the static we all left.

Wait 'til the time has come, figure that's where time comes from.
Leaving all my senses numb, is heaven.
Lifted up the fatal scene, anything could never be.
Anything but play to me, in order.

All the static we all left.

Take it back for them to keep, fallen into something deep.
Not that I had made that leap, annointed.

Gym Class Heroes,New Friend Request (Amended Version),"I remember when I first laid eyes on you 
My man Tom introduced us but I was too shy to say hi 
When I finally built up enough nerve to drop a line 
You made it clear you wasn't just another MySpace mistress
 
And I didn't take it personal 
When you ignored my request to be your friend I spilled my guts and hit send 
Waited 2 weeks for a response and got nothing 
Honestly it only made me want you more 

Week 4 rolled around and I was this close to letting go 
But something wouldn't let me even though I hardly knew you 
It was plain to see we were meant to lock lips 
You knock me out with the brass knuckle tats on your hips 

I was on this website late night lurking 
When I got a message from you that was labeled urgent 
You said you weren't impressed by lame dudes with no game 
They're all the same tryin' to get your instant messenger name 

But the fact that you hittin' me back made me smile 
You must've saw somethin you liked when you was skimming through my profile 
You caught me at the most pivotal moment
So now I'm emailing my love with a dozen digital roses 

So click approve, so simple 
Show me some kind of sign and let me know it's time to make my move

Show me some kind of sign and let me know it's time to make my move 
Just click approve, come on girl 
Baby I'm one of a kind and I ain't got time to lose 

Let's face it, it's a sad situation when we have to resort to keyboards as a means of making relations 
But I don't have the patience, I get straight to the point 
So this is me at my most honest 
No egos, no Gym Class status, just Travis 

Love it or leave it, but you gotta admit 
On a scale of one to awesome I'm the shit 
Just get over it, it happened god damn it, I've been waitin too long 
Even wrote a song about, like to hear it, here it go 
If I'm being too annoying, let me know (just let me know)

But it's hard for me to not hate when I'm on MySpace 
I never see my face in your Top 8
Approaching 6 weeks now, it's kinda obvious that you're either occupied or playing a game 
All my money's on the latter, this is not a LOL matter 
Why would you pass up a chance this great? 

If there were two forces and I split them down the middle, I could swing back and forth for 3 days 
Rephrase
If I had two horses, and I beat them with authority, I'd gallop all the way to Canada to see your face 
But all I got is this Powerbook and iChat 

Besides I hit you all the time and you never write back 
I stay on my feet
Shit
And be persistent 'til my name is under who you would like to meet

Just click approve, come on girl 
Baby I'm one of a kind and I ain't got time to lose 

Who cares if we don't know each other's last name 
All I know is that I'm smitten with your pictures wishin' you would feel the same 
I admit I get a little jealous when other dudes leave you comments 
Don't let it gas you up, it's all nonsense 

Lately I been romancing the thought of me and you speaking in tongues in this mansion I bought 
But it's all wishful thinking 
Just give me some kind of sign to let me know I'm not freakin' you out 
And if you lovin' what I'm speaking about, then say something 

I check my inbox ten times and ain't nothin'
You probably busy doing something sexy 
I just hope I'm in your thoughts next time you log in 
And if not, ain't no love lost between you and me 
I'll be here when your man ain't fully down as he used to be 
So yeah it's time to sign out, my vision's getting blurry 
This is madness, XOXO dash Travis

Between me and you.

The Black Crowes,Girl From A Pawnshop,"With pawnshop eyes and a second hand frown
She sat silent at the table
Her boots were brown, well should she leave town
To play the role of lover expatriate
A nod to the waiter, always her flirty behavior
You know she always gets one on the house
She pulls out a letter
From a bag under her sweater
And before she reads she straightens her blouse

There's a passion in being alone
A grace in a loveless time
There's no new cross, there's no new sign
Only the sun and the changing tide

And out of respect, well really must confess
I never lost your number
I never lost your address
And if we remain friends at best
Sometime later no, no not yet
We'll smile and remember it like this

She put back the letter
One tear falls like a feather
And disappears on the bar room floor
The gratuity included
You know the letter concluded
P.S. with all my love

There's a passion in being alone
A grace in a loveless time
There's no new cross, there's no new sign
Only the sun and the changing tide

Emperor,With Strength I Burn,"Deep Green Dark Chaos
Blinded I run down these paths
By heart I know them
They lead to the soaring cliffs
Stout they stand above the water's edge
Lifeless

And this is my foundation
Cold stone
Formed only by winds and time
How invulnerable
Lifeless

Ahh...
I have longed to be at one with this
Yet, the waters call my name

For once I wish to see
The entity behind the voice
The face of this seduction
The beauty of my pain

Am I blessed or am I cursed by thy presence?
What is my crime?
What is my deed?
Is this life my redemption?
Shall I repent or proceed?

I hate my flesh
Its dimension poisoned my soul with doubt
It made me question the essence of...
The 'I'

Slaves are those of this world
Given freedom to lay the chains upon The Master
The wolf is no longer free
Release the chains and come for me

Suddenly, his mournful cries were stunned.
Out of the cold mist came three enthralling ships.
Sails torn by many a storm, and the bows adorned by the
most fierce gargoyles he'd ever laid eyes upon. Yet, the
crew they bore... Three times twelve in numbers. They
stood motionless, wrapped in grey, worn gowns.
And from behind their shadowed faces the seductive chanting.
Bidding him on board. without hesitation, he accepted.
And away they sailed...

Upon these seas
Wherein I drowned so many times
I scatter the ashes of destiny
Still my flame is in hunger

With fire in my heart
Shall I greet the shores ahead
Though, I know not what will burn...

Desire...

Ahh...
In the distance
I hear the waves wash over solid ground
And in this moment I am struck blind

Grant me sight so I can see
That which lies ahead of me
Cursed be my mortal eyes
For dying in this realm of death

Hear my call...

I return to the soaring cliffs
They truly shine of strength
Even though I nothing learned
With strength I burn...",sad,1997

Will the rapper survive?\""

Now it was a war it was like I was in Vietnam
But I kill 'em all, cause _Kamikaze_ was the bomb
Got a strap to my back and I ran in if I was a terrorist
Got 'em all scanned at this President's head everybody be calm
Die for my belief, but got out the rubbish because it
This cup of death, Death was not yet meant for me to drink from it
Thinkin how could I ever survive, I knew I was ready to ride
I even had C4 duct taped to my stomach but uhh

But you gotta have will and always be ready to come off the wall
They gon' be willin to test you and catch you if you talk the talk
But I'ma keep on with the struggle fuck leavin my body in chalk

Look at me now cause I'm standin on top of the globe (say what)
Makin big money for spittin my popular flow (say what)
Now look at the swagger of a platinum veteran servin 'em medicine
It's not a given to work cause I'm choppin them O's
Can't fuck with the swagger the haters just look at me nigh
I'm stickin them daggers in haters just look at them cry
The shit don't affact us effect us they wanna imagine
They take us lay 'em on the back, I'm makin 'em look at the sky
If I think they cool, I give 'em a dutch
If they break the rules, I give 'em a crutch
If they on the come up and I feel 'em I give 'em some dust
If they talkin shit I'ma bust at 'em and get 'em to hush
Get away clean, go high on the meter, I got the streetsweeper
A creeper believe I get deep as the word of a preacher (and I)
Lyrical retriever but good with them heaters
When I'm full of passion and fury like when you listen to Syleena (and I)
Went multi-platinum when I stepped on enemy grounds
Now bodies all over the world is fin' to be found
And _Kamikaze_ was successful now c'mon and feel _The Day After_

Hypnotized by you if I should linger
Staring at the ring around your finger
I have only come here seeking knowledge
Things they would not teach me of in college
I can see the destiny you sold
Turned into a shining band of gold

I'll be wrapped around your finger
I'll be wrapped around your finger

Mephistopheles is not your name
But I know what you're up to just the same
I will listen hard to your tuition
And you will see it come to its fruition

I'll be wrapped around your finger
I'll be wrapped around your finger

Devil and the deep blue sea behind me
Vanish in the air you'll never find me
I will turn your face to alabaster
When you find your servant is your master

And you'll be wrapped around my finger
You'll be wrapped around my finger
You'll be wrapped around my finger",sad,1983
Shania Twain,Raining On Our Love,"Remember me the way I was
The way I'd make you late for work
I had to hold you, just because

Remember you the way you'd wake me up
To love me once again
We were lovers, we were friends

But was I chasin' rainbows
Blinded by the sun
And did I take for granted
I'd be the only one?

I didn't know you were so lonely
Am I to blame for makin' you that way?
Did I neglect all that mattered?
With my head so far above
The clouds I didn't see
That it was raining on our love

Remember when, just to feel my touch
Was all you ever needed
Oh it used to be enough

Remember when love
Was a promise we would give our lives to keep
And no river ran as deep

But was I chasin' rainbows
Blinded by the sun
And did I take for granted
I'd be the only one?

I didn't know you were so lonely
Am I to blame for makin' you that way?
Did I neglect all that mattered?
With my head so far above
The clouds I didn't see
That it was raining on our love

I was taking all the love you had to give
But I was too lost in life to know
That without my love in return you could not live
Now she gives the love I did not show 

I didn't know you were so lonely
Am I to blame for makin' you that way?
Did I neglect all that mattered?
With my head so far above
The clouds I didn't see
That it was raining on our love",sad,1995

Pursuit Of Happiness,Down On Him,"Well, you try so hard to keep him
Keep him next to you
With all you have to go through
It's all that you can do
And those books that you've been reading
Tell you how to please your man
So you take it on yourself
Take it all into your hands
And go down on him again
When he's distant and he's moody
You're sure that it's your fault
You want to be the kind of woman
Who will be his one and all
You know it makes him happy
Know how to give a thrill
So you do what you have to
Or some other woman will
You go down on him again
Do you hide inside yourself
So that you don't bother him
Do you laugh and shrug it off
When resentment begins
You know he doesn't give back
As much as he could
Would you slit your throat to sate him
I don't think that you should
Go down on him again",sad,1988

Now I break out of my physical shell and exhale past this so called body
Used to go to the party, but now I sit and chill with a pen and a pad
Dropping ill philosophical science me and my dad, we talk about life and how it started
How we departed from life's path and probable right math
The task at hand is making people understand that were not who we think we are
But in this land of the lost the cost of souls could be so high
People be gettin high, wondering why we die
But it's all planned, forget your fear take the hand
We keep on returning cause the lessons need learning

Critics can step back and analyze, I energize, cosmic rays of days the igno
Then get my signal for the sun

So uh riddle me this, riddle me this like this
Melodical prodigal flows, hypnotical blows to brain pieces (ooh)
Telekinesis (ahh) when I reach this pinnacle, cynical, clinical
Microphone autobots, waiting on lotto spots, trying to rock
But yo they can't understand, there's only one plan
The time is at hand, in the year two zero one one
The people of the sun return to save the righteous children
Now, I know you wanna be on top of the world
Giving a diamond and pearl to your girl
Watching your jacuzzi swirl (uh), seems like material lust
We need to look up to the heavens for imperial trust (me)
It's kinda hard you rhyme sometimes everybody wants to scrutinize
Redefine who you are, but every person is a star
So let your light shine far, and praise god

Heaven only knows (only knows now), cause I don't understand (don't understand now)
Won't you tell me please (tell me please) what's the master plan (I wanna know the plan)

Mirah,Apples in the Trees (Live),"There should be no hesitation 
When the coast is clear 
You got a right to slide 
Right into place when the end is almost here 

So you think you got some rotten deal 
What a way to compromise 
It's a long long way 
Before you get to claim that final prize 

Looking at that sorry face 
I can recognize the fear 
But if you keep on looking up at night 
The stars will all appear 

See there's food for me, 
There's food for you 
There's gold that's in the air 
There's oceans deep and wide 
And there is love beyond compare 

There's apple in the trees 
Let's take all that we need

There's hope for you and me

Tom Cochrane,Revelations:  Visions In A Dream,"The innocent and the poor
They've got nothing to hide
But the rich recite in numbers
Their fear resounds in side

Children starve by the millions
The false of the lame
Of the foolish few who knew them
Then led them to the shame

The king he knights the players
They all know the score
But nobody told his mistress
She was pushing forty-four

I don't want to know
Where we're heading for
We don't have long to go
We'll hear footsteps in the dawn 
REFRAIN
'Cause it's just some sort of
Crazy ride we're on 


The queen she knows the exit
She's been there once or twice
Whe her saviour got ostricized
For selling free advice

And her knight in shining armour
Comes sliding through the door
Sporting suggestive glances
At all the dancers on the floor

Well I dreamt all those lonely people
I knew them by their names
But their faces lost their identity
In the fury of the flames

They talked in foreign riddles
Lik actors on a stage
But when the word came they were standing scared
Lost in a doomed age

Don't buckle under the pressure

Of confusion

And what has been proven

Hammock and a couple of trees
Swing low, if you please

Here is the reason you should listen and learn
'Cause quick schemes and fast living can kill ya
I know how the excitement and danger can thrill ya
But take it from somebody who knows
'Cause after all the highs, you're gonna feel all the lows
This is why knowledge of self is essential
'Cause if you don't have it, you may simply go mental
See, life is not a thing to be toyed wit

And straight to hell is where they're trying to take us

Based on Psalm 95:7-8, Hebrews 3:13

(Chorus) 
Don't let your heart be hardened - don't let your love grow cold 
May it always stay so childlike - may it never grow too old 
Don't let your heart be hardened - may you always know the cure 
Keep it broken before Jesus, keep it thankful, meek, and pure 

May it always feel compassion - may it beat as one with God's 
May it never be contrary - may it never be at odds 
May it always be forgiving - may it never know conceit 
May it always be encouraged - may it never know defeat 

May your heart be always open - never satisfied with right 
May your heat be filled with courage and strengthened with all might 

Let His love rain down upon you 
Breaking up your fallow ground 
Let it lossen all the binding 
Till only tenderness is found",happy,1987

Words are just words
And you've heard them before

You feel you can't go on this way
It's hard to recognize the stranger
In your mirror

Ooh, you're jaded beyond your years
And you've come undone
Waiting for the sun, oh yeah

And when a friend cannot be found
When the world just wants to drag you down
Like a slow weight tumbling to the ground, hold on

Oh, it's too much to bear
Look around, look around, tears are falling everywhere
At the end of the day we all feel the same, oh yeah

And when a friend cannot be found
When the world just wants to drag you down
Like a slow weight tumbling to the ground, hold on

When you're sure you've had all you can take
When you feel your heart begin to break
When it's easier to throw it all away, hold on

Cowboy Mouth,Disconnected,"Have you ever felt a thunder inside your heart
Holding on to all the shit that's gonna tear you apart
If you can't free yourself there ain't no brand new start
So you gotta let go

I once had a friend who lived in an eastern town
He moved back home and called and started hanging around
But every time I tried to talk to him he'd put me down
So I gotta let go

Nobody knows who you are
Nobody cares who you are
Nobody knows why you feel
Disconnected. (Disconnected)
Disconnected.

Maybe it's the way I'm told I ought to look and feel
Maybe it's because my mind is so easy to steal
That I'm living in a world where nothing here is really real
So I gotta let go

How do I get the fuck out of this place? (How do I get the fuck out of this place?)
How when I look in the mirror do I not see my face? (How when I look in the mirror do I not see my face?)
Can I turn in my membership card to the human race
'Cause I gotta let go

When I feel like I'm slowly going out of my head
When I'm battling the moments when I wish I was dead
When my mind and body feel like fire and stone
And I know I'm gonna spend all my life alone

That's when I need to cover up my heart and soul
I only gain perspective when I lose control
Is it better to be crying when you feel insane
Or laughing out loud dancing naked in the rain

Have you ever felt a thunder deep inside your heart
Lettin' go of all the shit that's gonna tear you apart

Nobody knows who you are (Nobody knows who you are)

Amoral,The Last Round,"When you tricked them into your condemned dream
You didn't know who would have control

Where it took seconds to shape fortunes
Your pains it weighed down hell
Spilling blood to cleanse the memories
That you know made you so frail

Empty eyes look through the barrel, sweating fingers on the gun
One push off the threshold to target sympathies
Just a broken statue and the world remains unchanged
So close and still no place where anything would end

Trapped between blooded walls
And the fight was there today
Fists breaking against the concrete
None to forgive no strength to run

How could it be how would it end?
When you wake up you wish them to cry
Fragments of this being fragments of its meaning to burn away

Suffocating in the grasp of this hate
Driven to fire your last round
Escape from the air and drown under the earth
Dead mirror by the wayside, nowhere to turn

An empty shell buried to the ground
Prepare yourself to forfait
Another saviour just another failure
Where bleak winds grind the surface

Fear and regret stain dim recollections
An act of rash solutions
Last one there, the broken statue
Built with hands that are bleeding

Empty eyes look through the shattered image
And their pain it weighs down hell
Spilling blood to cleanse the memories
That you know make you so frail

How could it be how would it end?
When you wake up they are holding your time
Fragments of this being fragments of its meaning",sad,2004

On dream crystal potions
Behind silken sails
Cold marble laughter
Is taking my mind
2 a world of illusion
Spaceless in time

Magdalaine catch me when I fall

For years I have wandered
In solitude cried
I reach out 2 touch
The love so denied
Smell of magnolia
Your presence is near
My love is eternal
Perfect and clear

Magdalaine listen 2 my call
Catch me when I fall
Lost as the ocean
High as the sky

Voices violent eyes
Ruby death and stormy skies
Zodiac child of fire
Everlasting sweet desire

And conjure pagan ritual lust
We cast our spell into the sky
We sacrifice a life to live, some one must die
He's calling, he's calling, he's calling

A sacrificial lamb in white
There will be blood tonight
The ceremony flames ignite
There will be blood tonight
A virgin drowns in the sea of light
Come all you faithful while the moon's full
Just believe and thy work will be done here

Secret coven, reach for clear
The holy spirit gemini
The seven sisters two of nine
Now wait for the sign
He's coming, he's coming, he's coming
There will be blood tonight
Messiah come reveal your light
There will be blood tonight
Our sacred shadow rise to life
There will be blood tonight
A hanged man soul is our dark knight
From him which is witch's to come
Salvation for archangel's son
Washed our sins with his own blood
Drowning rats die in the flood

To love without fear

And finally I find that I am strong enough
To listen to this voice within
Telling me to throw all caution to the wind 

My heart beats like thunder
And I am not afraid
'Cause baby you showed me the way

A road paved with heartaches and tears
And I'm seeing the past that I've wasted

And the dreams that I've made, now are empty

Cut all the lines so the phones don't ring 
But stay here once from spring to spring 
Watching the ice melt the mornings sing 

Oh my my the Mystic River

Grabbed the weight up out the closet

Y'all know what happened last time I lost it
Can't tell you niggas what the fuckin' boss did
The game got a nigga exhausted
Gotta go for the big bargain they offered
Twenty years for what?
Breaking these laws that's so corrupt
Taking these halls and fillin' 'em up
Some powder keg shit that's about to erupt
Ay y'all, I'm about to be stuck
Until the year two thousand, what the fuck?

A newspaper blown through the grass
Falls on the round toes
Of the high shoes of the old friends

Lost in their overcoats, waiting for the sunset
The sounds of the city sifting through trees
Settle like dust on the shoulders of the old friends

Sharing a park bench quietly?
How terribly strange to be 70

Silently sharing the same fears",sad,1968

Dies the calm 
With revulsion 
Comes the spite 

With the light 
Come the lightmares 
Waking Moloch 
Comes with the fall 

Succumb 
Withdraw your soul from this fallacy 
This infamy is not for us 

With the night 
Comes deliverance 
Comes the spark 
That sets us alight 

With the dark 
Comes remembrance 
Comes the halo 
Comes the flight 

And the ground takes a fall 

Torn upon winds of witchery 
Resplendent wings unfold 
Revelling in lucid lechery 
We invoke what no eye can behold 

Azure, her gaping portal 
I blaze in ecstasy 
The goddess calls, immortal 
Shrugs off all treachery 

Stay down 
Wait for evenfall 
For the night to embrace us again 
Wait for evenfall 

Sleep now 
Wait for evenfall 
For the abyss will set us free

'Can't you find a woman of your kind and kin?'
'Samson, will you please your mother's mind?'

Well, he roared at the lion, the lion run
Samson was the first man the lion attach
He caught the lion and got upon his 'ack
A-written that he killed a man with his
And Sampson had his hand in the lion's jaws

Sewed me tow knot, an' formed a plot
Not many days 'fore Samson was caught
A-bind this hands whilst a-walkin' along
A-looked on the ground and found a lil' jawbone
He moved his arm ropes, a-pop like thread
Dropped those threads free, three thousand were dead

No batteries included, and no strings attached
No holds barred, no time for move fakin
Gots to get the loot so I can bring home the bacon
Brothers front, they say the Tribe can't flow
But we've been known to do the impossible like Broadway Joe so
Sleep if you want, Nyquil will help you get your Z's troop
But here's the real scoop
I'm all that and then some, short dark and handsome
Bust a nut inside your eye, to show you where I come from
I'm vexed, fumin, I've had it up to here
My days of payin dues are over, acknowledge me as in there (YEAH)
Head for the border, go get a taco
I'll be wreckin from the jump street, meaning from the get-go

And wow how now wow how now Brown cow

Papes make grapes great for the waist
I'm an L-AH, an E-ADER, simply just a leader
Bass in his face means peace see ya later
Later? (LATER!) Later alligator
Pop blows the weasel and my Earth the inflater

I-N-C into a flow
Funk flipped flat back first this foul fight fight fight
Laugh yo how's that sound (ohhhhhh!)

It's the leader Quest mission and we got the goods here (here!)
Never on the left cause my right's my good ear (ear!)
I could give a damn about a ill subliminal
Stay away from crime cause so ain't no CRIMINAL

No time for hibernation, only elation
Don't ever try to test, yo whattup little kid?
Yo Mr. Busta Rhymes, tell him what I did

Then baby puked then you had TO SMACK
Causin rambunction, throughout the sphere
Raise the levels of the boom, inside the ear

Won't ever waste no time on the played out ego

Heel up, reel up, bring it back, come rewind

Change your little drawers cause your pants are saggin
Try to step to this, I will, fits you in a turban
And had you smellin right, like some old stale urine

And souls are stigmatized with the sign of impurity

Lost our faith along the way and found ourselves believing your lies

I got my violence in high def ultra-realism
All a part of this great nation

Eminem,Beautiful,"I'm just so fuckin' depressed, I just can't seem to get out this slump
If I could just get over this hump, but I need something to pull me out this dump
I took my bruises, took my lumps, fell down and I got right back up
But I need that spark to get psyched back up in order for me to pick the mic back up

I don't know how or why or when, I ended up in this position I'm in
I'm startin' to feel distant again, so I decided just to pick this pen
Up and try to make an attempt to vent, but I just can't admit
Or come to grips with the fact that I may be done with rap, I need a new outlet

And I know some shit's so hard to swallow, but I just can't sit back and wallow
In my own sorrow, but I know one fact, I'll be one tough act to follow
One tough act to follow, I'll be one tough act to follow
Here today, gone tomorrow, but you'd have to walk a thousand miles

In my shoes just to see what it's like to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes, just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine, go inside each others' minds
Just to see what we'd find, look at shit through each others' eyes

But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you
So don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you 

I think I'm startin' to lose my sense of humor, everything's so tense and gloom I
Almost feel like I gotta check the temperature of the room, just as soon as I
Walk in, it's like all eyes on me and so I try to avoid any eye contact
'Cause if I do that, then it opens the door for conversation, like I want that

I'm not lookin' for extra attention, I just wanna be just like you
Blend in with the rest of the room, maybe just point me to the closest restroom
I don't need no fuckin' man servant, tryin' to follow me around and wipe my ass
Laugh at every single joke I crack and half of 'em ain't even funny like 
Unfortunately I am, I just hide behind the tears of a clown
So why don't you all sit down, listen to the tale I'm about to tell
Hell, we don't gotta trade our shoes and you ain't gotta walk no thousand miles

In my shoes just to see what it's like to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes, just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine, go inside each others' minds
Just to see, what we'd find, look at shit through each others' eyes

But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you
So don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you 

Nobody asked for life to deal us, with these bullshit hands we're dealt
We gotta take these cards ourselves and flip 'em, don't expect no help
Now I could have either just sat on my ass and pissed an' moaned
Or take this situation in which I'm placed in and get up and get my own

I was never the type of kid to wait by the door and pack his bags
Or sat on the porch and hoped and prayed for a dad to show up who never did
I just wanted to fit in, in every single place, every school I went
I dreamed of being that cool kid, even if it meant actin' stupid

Aunt Edna always told me, 
Meanwhile I'm just standin' there, holdin' my tongue tryin' to talk like this
Till I stuck my tongue on that frozen stop sign pole at 8 years old
I learned my lesson then 'cause I wasn't tryin' to impress my friends no more

But I already told you my whole life story, not just based on my description
'Cause where you see it from where your sittin' it's probably 110% different
I guess we would have to walk a mile in each others' shoes at least
What size you wear, I wear 10's, let's see if you can fit your feet

In my shoes just to see what it's like, to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes, just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine, go inside each others' minds
Just to see what we'd find, look at shit through each others' eyes

But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you
So don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you 

 (Oh)
 (So)
 (Oh)
 (So)


Yeah, to my babies, stay strong. Dad'll be home soon.
And to the rest of the world, God gave you them shoes, to fit you.
So put 'em on and wear 'em.
Be yourself, man. Be proud of who you are.
Even if it sounds corny, don't ever let no one tell you you ain't beautiful.",happy,2009
Mariah Carey,Mine Again,"I remember when you used to be mine
Way back when
I was too naive to love you right
But now if I only had the opportunity
I would do anything
Because my heart still believes

Maybe you could be mine again
Maybe we could make the dream for real
Like way back then
When love was yours and mine
Maybe we could bring it back to life

Its irrelevant to dwell in the past
I'm accountable for what went bad
And I mean that
But I keep on praying for another chance
Just to have you back
'cause I've grown
And I know how to be your everything

Maybe you could be mine again
Maybe we could make the dream for real
Like way back then
When love was yours and mine
Maybe we could bring it back to life

Oh, no it ain't over yet
I just can't accept the possibility
We were made for each other's arms
I know you're my destiny
We can't erase what was meant to be
Part of you and part of me
If we try one more time
Maybe somehow we'll survive

Maybe you could be mine again
Maybe we could make the dream for real
Like way back then
When love was yours and mine
Boy, maybe we could bring it back 
Maybe we could bring it back
Maybe we could bring it back
To life

Maybe you could be mine again",sad,2005

Knowing now that it's wrong

But the hardest thing is there's no one else to blame but me
So I guess I have to take it like a man
But I don't know if I'll ever love again
yeah...yeah

Cuz this pain I'm feeling inside is like a hollow point through my heart
I know that it's kinda crazy
But I feel like I'm falling apart
Usually I'm so cool, but I lost it when
She walked away
Lost without her...and she's gone

Gone...gone...gone
Don't think she's ever coming back

Gotta face it she's gone...gone

Without some kind of intervention
I can't go on another day...oh
And I can't even bare to mention
The very sound of her name
Without the sky turnin into clouds
Without the rain falling down
Falling down...again...again
I can't face the fact that she's gone

Gone...gone...gone
Don't think she's ever coming back
It's killing me

My word is like a hammer like a shattering rock, 
crack through your heart and take the evil apart 

From the end of the earth unto you I call, time and again I fall, back to you I crawl 
You have been a refuge for me, a tower of strength in the face of the enemy 
Enemy, enemy lines I find I let myself get tied up too many times 
You can't have my heart I'm taking back what's mine 
I know it lie just smoke in your eye and you saved my soul from the other side 

When faint grows my heart to a rock that too hard for me to climb alone lead me 
For you have been a refuge 

With you I smash a troop and with my G-d I leap over a wall 
May the king answer you on the day that you call 
Stand tall, battle yawl, the clouds crawl low, all stalled, 
heavens lay draped over New York like a prayer shawl,

From that old memory that don't remember me

And tonight he has it on
And I remember the feel of his skin
And I can't help but go back there again

look outside the hotel window and my soul wanders off me

Go find your fortune fast, its cold outside but you'll make it

To be fucked up when I gets into my clownin mode
Then go to clown up on they ass like Bozo
Oh no, then dance on top of they asses like I was Jo Jo Dancer
Come Comet, come Dasher, come Prancer
Come niggaz with machine guns, I think that is the answer 
But the question 'Should we take that bullshit from them people?'
I'm makin 300 on my SAT and I am equal
Ain't no sequel, no saga, no way out, I'm nervous
I've had it up to fo'head of niggaz tryin to serve us
To graduate is really becomin a very stressful journey
I feel like a steering wheel, for them is tryin to turn me
Into a hate monger, and I'm wishin and I wonder
Damn, will I graduate before I hit the summer
I think not, Officer Friendly tryin to dig up in me
He said I'm half assed and got no future 
And so he sent me up the creek and shit
Strokin like hell without no paddle

Smokin that dang dang, makin mics swang
In my 2-8-0 Z, nobody can see me

Ain't no playas in office cuz I'm locked off in a cell
So can you feel me, nigga

chorus:

[Khujo]
Khujo, comin in dope, bring it
I got more problems than the average Joe
So don't come 'round me with your flim flam, hot damn
It's a jack, top of the burbs, and my notebook is a bird
K's madness into cappin
Throwin to do more load, so my fire lookin through the want ads
And only red hot, desire in your pot with somethin wicked
But you can't feel it, stickin out your monkey ass
I could let shit rot in the past, now it's time to blast they ass
Shhh...Mr. Knighton take off your hat
Can't even my wear my locs in
Demon eye scopin, oh my, peripheral vision got it 
Made you go on your hoe's bar
Decisions, decisions to make, oops, here comes the Goodie Mo crew
And they just might want to battle you
Out with the quickness
The price of livin is beginning to be a risky business
Unkay, Parkay. 
How do you like the taste of hot butter meltin through your biscuits?
This is your brain on drugs, this is your brain...
Don't cut niggaz I hang with before there were apartments
In Chapel Forest, it's gettin horrid
The huntin child is on the prowl, yahhh!!!!!

But I was too blind to see
That you seduce every man
This time you won't seduce me

Hey Baby, do as you please

She knows when they come to town
Every musician's fan 
After the curtain comes down
She waits at backstage doors
For those who have prestige
Who promised fortune and fame
A life that's so carefree

She's saying, ""That's okay
Hey baby, do what you want
I'll be your night loving thing
I'll be the freak you can taunt
And I don't care what you say

Why don't you come with me?""

She's probably worried tonight
I didn't call on the phone 
To say that I'm alright""

Diana walked up to me,
She said, ""I'm all yours tonight.""

The Fabulous Thunderbirds,Why Get Up,"Carter-Ellsworth

Why get up, why get up
How can I get up, why should I get up
This whole world's gone crazy
Think I've seen enough
I'm gonna sleep forever why get up

Phone keeps ringing right off the hook
Some bill collector, I know what cooks
Think I'll stay in bed, dream all day
World outside bugs me anyway
When I get things going, the going gets rough
So I ask myself why get up

Chorus

Went to the doctor, he said lose some weight
If you don't do it quick, we'll have to operate
I talked to my lawyer, he said case is closed
That woman got it all even the garden hose
Staring at the ceiling thinking just my luck
Better roll back over why get up

Chorus

Well I can't quit drinking, I'm nervous all the time
When I wake up, it's like a ton lead on my mind
What was it, I said to that girl last night
She really got upset, I best stay out of sight
I remember a gun and calling somebody's bluff
I better duck under the cover why get up",sad,1986

It starts a chain reaction
That's now the pain it all starts 

It's going down where no one can see
It's a sad sad sight
The feeling just gets stronger
I see you, I just put on a smile
I try to cover it up
But I can't take it too much longer 

Time stands still, as I lie in place
I try to block out the pitch
In my head that keeps ringing
So I pound and pound on myself
I try to wake myself up
But I can't 'cause I'm not dreaming 

It's going down in my dark side
With no release or escape
Doesn't beleave in forgiveness
It's an emotion rape 

It's going down where no one can see
It's sad sad sight
No suspense as what will follow
Fractured terror fills my peace
Shocks my senses
Leaves me empty sad and hollow

In my head that keeps ringing

I try to wake myself up

It's going down in my dark side
Shivers and shakes through my soul
Ration surveys the damage
There's nothing left to control 

It's going down now, I'm face to face
With the hollowness
That echos in this darkness
How can I fight when I cannot see what to fight
Reluctanly how can I even stop this
All hell is breaking loose
Now panic rules as emotions blazed on fire 

I'm goin' down down down down down
I'm goin' down

Crossing all the borders just to take their share

Rio de Janeiro in an afternoon
People out of work but there's people on the moon

Juggernauts carving up the countryside
Cars by the million on a one-way ride
Using up the future

And we're so abused, and we're so confused
It's easy to believe that someone's going to light the fuse
Can't happen here, can't happen here
All that you fear, they're telling you can't happen here

Satellites spying for the C.I.A.
The K.G.B. and the men in grey
Wonder if I'm going to see another day
Somewhere in the future

We got everything we need for a peaceful time
Take what you want but you can't take mine
Everybody's living on the Siegfried line
Worried 'bout the future

Oh if in battle he was slain
I'm sure that I should die
but I'm sure he'll come again
And cheer my weeping eye

But should he fall 
In this our glorious cause
He still would be my joy 
For many a sweetheart mourns the loss
Of a Southern soldier boy

I hope for the best
And so do all
Whose hopes are in the field
I know that we shall win the day
For Southerns never yield

And when we thing 
Of those who are away
We'll look above for joy

Pain, tragedy, and much heartache
The tears she hides, the smile she fakes
And through it all, she doesn't break

The Ataris,The Hero Dies in This One,"As I leave here today
Apartment 108
I'll always keep you in my heart
Anderson is cold tonight,
The leaves are scattered on the ground
I miss the seasons in the comfort of your smile

Sometimes this song feels like a dream,
I'm waiting for someone just to wake me up from this life
As I look out on these fairgrounds,
I remember how our family split apart

I don't think I ever told you,
but I know you always did your best
in the hard times that only made us stronger

As I sit here all alone,
I wonder how I'm supposed to carry on
when you're gone

I'll never be the same without you,
I love you more than you will ever know
So maybe now you finally know:
sometimes we're helpless and alone,
but you can't let it keep you weighted down
You must go on

Do you ever feel like crying?
Do you ever feel like giving up?
I raise my hands up towards the sky
and say this prayer for you tonight,
because nothing is impossible

As I sit here all alone,
I wonder how I'm supposed to carry on
when you're gone

I'll never be the same without you,
I love you more than you will ever know
So maybe now you finally know: 
sometimes we're helpless and alone,
but you can't let it keep you weighted down
You must go on

The hardest part isn't finding what we need to be, 
it's being content with who we are

Stay who you are

Stay who you are
Stay who you are

Stay who you are
Stay who you are",sad,2003
Fall Out Boy,Dance_ Dance,"She says she's no good
With words but I'm worse
Barely stuttered out ""a joke of a romantic""
Or just stuck to my tongue

Weighed down with words too
Over-dramatic
Tonight it's ""it can't get much worse""
Versus ""no one should ever feel like""

I'm two quarters and a heart down
And I don't want to forget how your voice sounds
These words are all I have so I'll write them
So you need them just to get by

We're falling apart to half time

And these are the lives you'd love to lead
Dance, this is the way they'd love if they knew
How misery loved me

Before you're found out
Drink up, it's last call, last resort
But only the first mistake and

I'm two quarters and a heart down
And I don't want to forget how your voice sounds
These words are all I have so I'll write them

Shaken
Is life a mystery to you
Are you stumbling around
Without clues
Well take heart, even though you
Are weary
And worn, clear to the bone
Just remember that you're not
Alone

You just hold on
Don't be afraid
You just hold on to the Promised
One
You just hold on
Don't be dismayed
He'll never let you down
You better hold on
You have been chosen
Just hold on to the Promised One
You better hold on
Believe in the Lord Of Love

When it seems that the trials and
Troubles of life are larger
Than you
Follow Him He will see you
Through

Soul is weak
Just believe in the one you seek
The God Of Truth won't betray
You
He sent his Spirit to stay with you",happy,1982
Patty Griffin,Moses,"Diamonds, roses I need Moses
To cross this sea of loneliness, part this red river of pain
I don't necessarily buy any key to the future or happiness
But I need a little place in the sun sometimes or I think I will die

But everywhere is somewhere and nowhere is near
Everybody got somebody with their wine and their beer
So I'm just this tragic figure in the corner over here
With an empty apartment and a best friend who is a queer

Every time I see him he smiles 
And tells me how well he is walking these miles
But he never ever asks a single thing about me
If I die he'd hear about it eventually

Diamonds, roses I need Moses
To cross this sea of loneliness, part this red river of pain

An everywhere is somewhere and nowhere is near
Everybody got somebody with their wine and their beer
So I'm just this tragic figure in the corner over here
Go home to an empty apartment and call a best friend who is queer

Strange days have tracked us down
They're goin' to destroy our casual joys
We shall go on playing or find a new town

Strange eyes fill strange rooms
Voices will signal their tired end
The hostess is grinning
Her guests sleep from sinning
Hear me talk of sin and you know this is it

Strange days have found us
And through their strange hours
We linger alone
Bodies confused
Memories misused
As we run from the day
To a strange night of stone",sad,1967

Though fate kept us humble and made our love true
But plans that we made up someone seems to break up
Oh darling what else can we do
We may have to leave here to find piece of mind dear
Some place where we can live a life of our own
For I know you love me and happy we could be if some folks would leave us alone

When I go out walking there's lots of loose talking
They say we're unhappy and we'll break apart
But darling it's not true because I still love you and I do it all of my heart
We may have to leave here...

They say you are leaving that you are deceiving
But you tell me they say the same about me
But we'll show them there on that loose talk and do harm
And hope that's the truth they will see
We may have to leave here...",happy,1990

(Verse 1)
Call this bitch yor nigga when time is rough
I lost a lot when you fell, life is hard to bluff
You think its hell where you at 
Shit its hell on the streets
You maintaining in the Bing, I'm surviving to eat
Don't think am wilding, flexing whips and stuff
Thinking I'm lost laying down
Sex for trips and stuff
I'll admit it I'm use to the finer things,
We had major names even on the minor things
Everywhere we went, mad bitches sizing me up
You know they tight now, shit I get to drive the trucks
But I wish you were spreading it riding it rough
I think I miss that more then you buying me stuff
Since you got knocked your man tried to hollar at me
And those nigga's you stuck, they throwing dollars at me
But you know this gaming, and Im just keeping it real
Holding you down until you back on the field

(Chorus 2x)
Feels like I do
I feel when feeling down
In the ground feeling down
It can be most anyday

(Verse 2)
Don't worry 'bout these streets I'm conrolling these grounds
I might slip and miss a V-I but I'm holding it down
Got the kids to take care its hard out here
And its tearing my heart to play my part out here
I seen that snitch and you know I got plots 4 years
And your bid make me feel like I got the chair
But ain't nobody tapping this I rather tap my own
Watching tapes we made while I'm resting alone
Wishing you home, pictures of you flipping the chrome
What kind of chic will leave her man when he out the zone
Me without you is like a stickman without a silencer
Got me X-ing off days on the calendar
I miss loading the glock so you could control the block
I miss watching you work the dogs to tighten the lock
Think of the time boo pushing it like a 6 double o
You get your weight up I'm a drain you once they let go

Chorus

(Verse 3)
I can see us back on the bricks, me on your shoulder
Letting bitches know they wishes to have you are over
So you ring your broads while you locked away
I know its hard for a nigga on top not to play
See Amil's the one you kept draped in ice
I'm the one waiting silk down caked in spice
Waiting for your calls or my box to vibrate
Hoping you want me to come scoop you not being more weight
I fell from Gucci sandals back to no name brands
From a six and a mansion to beating the sands
Staying true make ends meet to have enough for the love I take
All-savage and stuff
Have a brick where most F.E.D.S. dare to touch
Fear none to see the cash, and us popping the clutch
Chopping a Dutch-flip cop twice as much living low key
A minute then heist and stuff
If I have to wait while you gone I'm a take what comes
If you don't see cash, know its hard in the slums
Cause I ran through the stash and it ain't no funds",sad,2000

The branches, the bones of the liars and thieves
Rise up above it, high up above and see

Pray to your god, open your heart
Whatever you do, don't be afraid of the dark
Cover your eyes, the devil's inside

One day I will get revenge
One night to remember
One day it'll all just end, oh

Blessed by a bitch from a bastard's seed
Pleasure to meet you but better to bleed
Rise, I will rise, I will rise
Skinned her alive, ripped her apart
Scattered her ashes, buried her heart
Rise up above it, high up above and see

Pray to your god, open your heart
Whatever you do, don't be afraid of the dark
Cover your eyes, the devil inside

One day I will get revenge
One night to remember
One day it'll all just end, oh

Tear you to pieces and rip you apart

One night of the hunter
One day I will get revenge
One night to remember
One day it'll all just end, oh

Hatebreed,Boxed In (Subzero),"The Burning air seems so cold
Thinking back to the days of old
Wondering where I tripped and went wrong
Searching for myself only gone
Sentenced to death not much time
I sit in my cell awaiting each chime
All tied up in thoughts of my past
But now it's too late, I'll never last

NO FEELINGS for what I've left behind
NO GUILT for the victims of my crime
NO CONSCIENCE just a burning deep inside
NO PAIN I'm here just to die",sad,2009
Jennifer Lopez,Play,"I could wait all night and day

Twista & The Speedknot Mobstaz,Warm Embrace (LP Version),"(Liffy Stokes) 
It's like I got the 4 4 cocked 
On the block in it two door dropped 
And my spot is keepin' but hot 
The pussy ass cop throw some murder in the lot 
My nigga got popped with a bullet that was meant for me 
The adapt by T's and B's and the regencies 
F**k what the reason be I'ma start squeezin' these 
Them niggas ain't G's they wanna be thugs 
And it ain't shit these ain't no muthaf**kin' slugs 
The fools and plugged plus ain't no hoes over here 
I done dropped more dead bodies than tears 
Brought to life momma's worst fears 
Pictures of a son dyin' from that hot ones flyin' 
Baby mama's cryin' at the funeral 
'Cause the magnum lit him like a black (?) 
When I rolled out on his ass on the solo 
I caught him up on mo-mo cookin' up co-co 
I got to tip on the low-low 
Bust it there like po-po takin' lives with the, oh no 
It's a 4-4 many missles with a silent sub for the whistle 
My favorite pistol 
'Cause when I let that bitch ride 
I know the homicide is being counted out, it's official 
Niggas steady bumpin' guns, but don't want none 
Because of these hot ones that explode on contact 
A maniac just prepared to die in combat 
Besides all that my 4-4 keeps my laced: Dawg he paid and safe 
I can see the fear in your face as I reach my waist for this warm embrace 

(Chorus) 
I got plenty love for the 4-4 
But when I pick it up, I don't wanna let it go 
Because a nigga straight lovin' your warm embrace 
I got plenty love for the 4-5 
But when I pick it up, I don't wanna let it ride 
But still I bust 'cause I survive from your warm embrace 
I got plenty love for the nine-mill 
And when I pick it up, I don't really wanna kill 
But still I bust because I'm needin' your warm embrace 
All you muthaf**kas better duck and hide 
Before I let it ride, the sucka stepped aside 
Still I bust because I'm lovin' your warm embrace 

(Mayz) 
I love the element of surprise when I'm taking these hoes lives 
With my customized 4-5 
Get enough ammunition to knock off you, your crew and some more guys 
You muthaf**kas better get wise 
Make sure your first shot is sweet, tryin' to kill the elite 
'Cause you ain't gettin' no more tries 
Make the nigga's nubian mother weap, but f**k it 
As long as I don't get whole cries 
Put the beam between his eyes and make that bitch nigga so wise 
No matter what the size of the warm embrace of my forty-five 
Make sure that nigga crossed me dies 
You don't wanna throw them thangs 
When I cocked and aim (?) think in these few seconds time 
But Mayz ain't new to the game 
I use the spark when we start to light up this thunderin' crime 
But niggas get bucked for dime and it's like you're a magnet for sin 
(?) pretend to be your friend 'til they get close enough to your ends 


To do you in, that shit puts me on ten 
And make me wanna put the barrel of this solid fiend 
Upon under that nigga's chin, plus he talkin' big shit about war 
Like he don't know my stee, now mob's gon' win 
But I dare one of you niggas to say my name 
'Cause I put a f**kin' bullet into your closest skin 
Just to get under your skin like a dirty syringe 
Plus I know you can't win with a gun or a pin 
So when you see Mayz come in the place you better say your grace 
Before I f**k up your face like a can of mace 
Before I get disgraced, I'ma catch a case 
Maybe you hoes fear the wrath of my warm embrace 

(Chorus) 

(Twista) 
Would you (..?..) of the team, for sure 
Hold you ever so tightly, I love you nina and never wanna let you go 
Miss millimeter's makin' the (?) muthaf**kas gotsta be ruckus 
When I get my clutches upon this hoe 
Itchin' to let the barrel blow 
Like a sparrow, how it flow, like an arrow (..?..) 
Spit 'em up and swallow slow 
I reload, clippin' your ass crack, you constantly blast back 
Payback from flashback, some bitches know 
Bust 'til I see the chrome from the intro 
You was f**ked from the phasin', deep with the cuts and abrasion 
Erupts and amazin', nigga, my nina bucked 
F**k the gauge and enemies get (?) up from the blazin' 
Fool you be burnin' them with your black ass 
Murderous hips, hurtin' the grips, ride on personal list 
Deposition die for servin' them six 
Everyone of 'em with a hit but some are missin' of a jerk to the kick 
'Cause I be working my bitch 
Tryin' to pimp her but she a wild and a tame thang 
Kick a static on when she gangbang, blast in the fullest moon 
Niggas better pull it soon or else suffer hellafied bullet wounds 
And even though I stay clubbed with some thugs, why call 'em stug 
When it comes to (?) run about she draw my blood 
Static under the bra 'cause everytime I take a hit at the bud 
And give you a hug you gon' pop up a slug 
Drinkin' remy on the block, gotta bust the glock 
When the henny hit the chest, bustin' smith-n-wess 
F**k the discussion, I'm bustin' 'em all, clutchin' my balls 
If I see I'll be laid to rest, let me hit the sex 
Lose (?) but used to be a problem solver 
But the nina made me a baller 
Go strapped and take the place of the black nine 
Leave 'em flat lines, feelin' fury, you was born to taste 
From my warm embrace 

(Chorus) 

I got plenty love for the 4-4, 4-4, 4-4 
Warm embrace 
I got plenty love for the 4-5 (4-5), 4-5 (4-5), 4-5 
Warm embrace 
I got plenty love for the nine-mill (Nine-mill), nine-mill",happy,2008
Pursuit Of Happiness,No Safe Place,"I've got a little girl, though I know it won't be long
Before she finds another boy who will sit her by the fireplace
And sing her a song
It feels like there's no safe place
In a world that's come apart
And the deafening sound of a bursting bubble
Wakes you up with a start
Is there nowhere that is safe
Why can't we change the rules so I win
All I need is an escape
A temporary place to hide
When she's coming in the door when she's walking out the door
hard to tell which is worse
That false feeling of relief when she comes in
Or the empty feeling when she's gone
And every night on the streets the forces of darkness
Score another victory
And I stand with the timid waiting for the devil
To make a martyr of me
[chorus]
Fold up the tents and load up the trucks
'cause it's time to move on
If we only knew where to go
I hope that we'd already be gone
And even when we're lying together, I make sure she falls asleep first
It seems when things are at their best, my mind starts to wander
to things at their worst
So do I fall asleep and dream of a peace that never will come
Or do I roll over and let her break the glass around my heart
And set off the alarm
[chorus]",sad,1990
Redman,Jam 4 U,"*inhales, starts coughing*
Yo, this is for motherfuckers -- that talk that sellout shit

""I just want to jam for you"" (repeat 2X)
""Ev-everybody get up!""
""I just want to jam for you"" (repeat 2X)
""Get on up!""

""Get down, get down, on down.."" like James Brown plus I get down
But for now I ""Get on up!"" rhythm and funk
Makes you hump like Technotronic I'll make the Jam Pump
Strong to the finish when I freak the fly gimmick like
""Du-na-da-du-duh!"" without eating my damn spinach
Cause when I'm on a roll, that's when Redman start
""to chill..."" round off backflip cartwheel
""Ahhhhhh, you guessed it!"" I know
When my afro grow that mean more rhymes to flow
But I continue, on the menu, and send you
On a jam that earthquakes the whole damn venue
It's like this, it's like that, I won't slack
I pack more steel than the cops pack blackjacks
Word is bond, the quiet storm broke your arm
When I sound off from here all the way to Hong Kong
Drop pound for pound to throwdown and strut
Yo E what's that funk mode? ""Get on up!""

""I just want to jam for you"" (repeat 2X)
""Ev-everybody get up!""
""I just want to jam for you"" (repeat 2X)
""Get on up!""

Check this out here, let the rough cut cut your ear
Hit Squad's the crew I'm twenty-two and Beck's the beer
Float like Muhammad, roll-on like Secret
Me rip, the crowd in half on the sneak tip
Til they crumble, too humble for you to stumble
I sting like a bu-bee while the others bum-bumble
Don-dan-dan, do-do-dan-ding
Extremely wild, like the hair on Don King
Cause I kick the mode to make your brain explode
It's the HUH, the funk, now I'm known around the globe
So buckle up, hush up, while I freak the funk to get down
With the sound, grab my bozack then I freeze now...
... on your mark, get ready, get set, let's go
With the flow to jet like Delta, or Jesse O.
Whiz with the bends I clean my front lens
With a system, that knocks harder than Rin-Tin-Tin
Without question, I'm flexy when I'm sexin
Wicked when I Kick It like A Tribe Called Quest-in
The rude Redman rip backbones and hips to bits
Then split ya from your wrist to your armpits
But true indeed, since pop's dropped the seed
I knew I'd be, the funkiest brother that ever bleeds
Rough and rugged, more nuggets in the bucket
That's dum dum dollars, and yes Redman love it
Pound for pound, I throw down to make ya strut
Yo E what's that funk mode? ""Get on up!""

""I just want to jam for you"" (repeat 2X)
""Ev-everybody get up!""

Silverstein,BLEEDS NO MORE (Live Version),"My heart bleeds no more
Now, it's been turned to stone
Your stomach feels sick for someone else 
But I've broken both my legs falling for you 
Drag me on the ground.

Powerless I stand,
Tarnished blade, cutting through, 
Pushed into my vein, blood still stains my hands 
Sharpening my sense of pain outside

My heart bleeds no more
Now, it's been turned to stone
Your stomach feels sick for someone else 
But, I've broken both my legs falling for you 
Drag me on the ground.

Killing everything off inside. 
Make sense of everything you tried to hide, 
hide from me. 

My heart bleeds no more
Now, it's been turned to stone. 
My stomach feels sore from cutting up. 
But, I ruined all my sanctity for you. 
Smash me on the ground. 

I wanted to convince myself there's nothing else to do 
I wanted to provide you with proof of what you put me through
I wanted to pretend that it was you.
(You're the worst thing that ever happened to me!)

Die!
Killing everything off inside
Make sense of everything you tried to hide 
Hide from me

My heart bleeds no more
Now, it's been turned to stone
Your stomach feels sick for someone else
But I've broken both my legs falling for you
Smash me on the ground.",sad,2006
Twista,It Feels So Good (Album Version),"(INTRO) This goes out to all riders worldwide
Let that playa ass nigga Twista be your guide as we go on a ride
where playa hatin killers and the hood niggaz thrive
And lame motherfuckers can barely survive

(Verse 1)
One morning I woke up next to a thick bitch
Took a shower dried off brushed the gold teeth like Slick Rick
Tapped on Obsession colonge like Doug E. Fresh in the flesh
Think I'm blessed with the zest after slippin on my slick fit
The high discover me, hit the front porch
Two women butterly lovely in front of me got my head gone
I sent the bitch in the bed home cuz one of them
got chocolate big thighs and the other one was a redbone
Where y'all goin y'all thick as hell
What's your name I wanna get up with y'all tonight shit
I got some homies that lonely never phony we on some hype shit 
Call up the buddies you be tight with
We ain't really gon be doin too much though
We just ridin around bumpin sounds trippin out while we flame janes 
Tappin the horn at the homies that gangbang
and slang 'caine to maintain to mob's the same thing
Or we can chill at the crib and play spades or kick some ass a bit
Speedpass the clit and get passionate
Grab the buckle and unfasten it
and we can get into some ol' nasty shit
Live if I could decide to try, don't play me bogus
This ain't no spin move and I ain't got no time to lie
Tell your girls we gonna be sliding by
but hit the weed tip first cause my clique got to be riding high
cause it feels so good

(Chorus)
It feels so good how we kick it in the hood like so good 
(When we ridin high)
Rollin through the hood with Phillies and hoes 
Straight pimpin with nowhere to go
And it feels so good the way we kick it in the hood like so good
(When we ridin high)
Rollin through the hood with Phillies and hoes
Straight pimpin with nowhere to go

(Verse 2)
Me and my homies hooked up some cowards took up
when niggas we lust smokin some but the flame tight
Trippin off how we survivin the rugged terrain
and try to hang tight getting fucked up on gang night 
Used to be gang fights now we gotta try to relax with the scrap
Even we sent Deebo back to back to back
We still be holdin' stacks of packs
Rollin through wit black blacks, blunt reds, ash trays, and crack sacks
Hustlin and chillin's what I'm focusin on
Fiendin through bitch's cribs hopin it's on
If ain't no strokin we strollin along
Rollin the chrome out really trippin
because we take the smoke to the dome
Bumpin the tunes while bigger roles and herringbones
glisten from all the sunlight
Peepin the fe's with their hair done tight
Booty hung right and every night we see at least one fight
Hookin up with my fellow Westside cliques 
Now together we mush
but when are we strapped through and rug cutters
Just like the envy and jealousy throughout the other is love brothers
Ridin every one of y'all my muhfuckers
So put the Black Magic on the tires and get the wax off the chrome
We gon' to blaze on till my brain's blown
Hopin to get my thang on
Not matter what block you stay on kick it
Round the world it's the same song
(so the Mobsters just flame on)
For scratch we was willin' to squirt some blood
Now we got up on hittin the cuz
From stealin' tips where they're swum the doves
mo' we got up on some bud
Straight hittin' up the block searching for love
Reach up and hit the deep lung then we gone
Smokin delight the body right what the party like
Are you as live as I come roll with meso we can ride the sky
But only if you let me play with you while we ridin' high
cause it feels so good

(Chorus)

(Verse 3)
Sittin back cruising through the slow breeze
thinkin how can I get mo' cheese
Bumpin a system costin 4 G's
I stay on my P's for the po-P's
Split the Phillie with my door keys
Scoop a female to the crib good get my boy to bring a blessin through
Sit on the floor playin Tekken 2
Lesson two I'm adressin you
Turn out the lights like the World Class Wreckin' Crew
Bring out the best in you 
Confessin true lies about your inner thighs
and where they been hopin maybe you be my lady
What's the potatoes without the gravy
what you feelin on maybe soft with the silicone baby
but can you pay me?
Cause daily we be riding in the dope stroll
while rockin dope flows I'll lose the spot if I choose to stop
We can cruise some blocks and talkin' about
how later on you comin' out your clothes, shoes and socks
Now is that news or not?
Come I step on the gas slow and smoke on this last ""O""
Get a ""B"" and split it now watch me kill it
Tinted windows took a sealin' off in the Astro
on billets take a choke on so I can really feel it
Thinkin' about not having the rich life
but the hood life was still a good life
and that we know always and forever though
for ever more rollin in the ghetto with nowhere to go
and it feels so good

(Chorus 3X)",happy,1997

Waiting to kill

Not 'cause he's hungry 'cause he's mean

You can see the shark now
Glidin' through the water
Ugly as death.


Eats anything
But the pretty barracuda, don't touch no leavins
Takin' what he wants to
'cause he's king
And you can't scare him or entice him
He won't move for the devil, 'til his own time
Then quicker than heartbeat
He'll turn you away girl just to
See you fall, and leave you dyin'

Jason Mraz,Did You Get My Message?  (Live From Shubas),"Did you get my message
The one I left while I was trying to condense everything that I meant
In a minute or less when I called to confess and make all of my stresses go bye-bye

Did you get my message
Didn't, I guess, 'cause if you did you would have called me with your sweet intent
And we could give it a rest instead of beating our breast, making all of the pressure go sky-high

Do you ever wonder what happens to the words that we send
Do they bend, do they break from the flight that they take
And come back together again with a whole new meaning
In a brand new sense, completely unrelated to the one I sent

Did you get my message, ooh
Did you get my message
Did you get my message, yeah, ooh

Uh oh, where did it go
Must have bypassed your phone and flown right outta the window
Oh well, how can I tell
Should I call the operator
Maybe she know the info
But whether or not if my message you got was too much or a lot to reply
Why not try this for a fact
Should you ever come back
I'd relax and be relieved of all my panic attacks

Ahh oooh
Did you get my message, ooh
Did you get my message, (Did you now?)
Did you get my message, yeah, ooh

Did you get my message, the one that I left
While I was trying to condense everything that I meant
Now the moment is passed
Not much sand in the glass and I'm standing to lose my mind

Do you ever wonder what happens to the words that we send
Do they bend, do they break from the flight that they take
And come back together again with a whole new meaning
To the matter of our love's defense, and please be sympathetic to the time I spent

Did you get my message, ooh
Did you get my message, (Did you now?)
Did you get my message, yeah, ooh

Did you get my message
No, I didn't hear a word
Did you get my message
Now I'm not gonna believe your lies anymore
Answer the question
I don't hear a thing from you and you keep saying you're coming
Did you get my message now that I wanna get back with you
Did you get my message, love that I wanna reconnect with you
Did you get my message, sugar now
I did not hear one thing you sent to me
Did you get my message, love
Answer the phone",sad,2007

Lets get it on I'm bad to the bone, edgin yo dome
What you know about a baby hummer sittin on chrome
Make moves like I'm grown with a style of my own
See the ice around my neck I go to school in a rover
Fifth grader seventy dollar phone two way pager
I'm a major, in other words I got flavor
I wreck mics rip shows and kick floors
Lil' Ro' got y'all throwin ya bows
I'm bout that if you hatin then stop that
Top that any club I rock that
Now rock that we takin our spot back
If you tryna stunt lil wodie I doubt that

I'm that cool cat nice with the ball, nicer than y'all
You better take your points cause you might not score
I'm guaranteed M.V.P. hit jumpers and score
Somethin like Allen I. but I play like I'm tall
Corn raise starch glaise when I walk through the mall
Let my pants sag and always find time to talk to 'em all

Keys in my pocket so these skills gonna do me
I practice y'all I'ma do this thing truly

Sound like a wild animal I need to be in a cage
I'm dangerous man in so many ways

I got my mind right I'm up in the limelight
I guess you hate me when you know that I rhyme tight
Nicer than nice I'm skillful make you think twice
Whats my name Lil' Ro, I'm larger than life
When I'm not pushin a hummer I'm ridin a bike
A Lil' Soulja what they call me I go off on the mic
If a ticket was around my neck it would be covered in ice
And my wrist stay blingin its a lovable site
I'm ragin on all types of stages
You might be nice but see I'm the greatest
Wanna see me take it home from the stages
I'm the one I'm tellin you son like the matrix

Seal,The Beginning (Giro E Giro Mix),"The beginning saw existence of a chosen dream
But then came pain
With energy striking on those she knew would uncover her lies
She felt she must destroy everything that we had prayed for
So she sent shameful claim in her lies
She wants us to be what's going on in her mind

Music takes you round and round and round and round and round,
Hold on to the love.

Music takes you round and round and round and round and round,
Hold on to the love.

She wants us to be what's going on in her mind.
If she is to take over she must prevent unity.
But oh how cold her life must be.
She knows she must destroy everything that we had prayed for.
So here comes shameful claim in her lies.

Curtis Mayfield,Superfly (Single Mix Version),"Darkest of night

Lotta things goin' on

The man of the hour
Has an air of great power
The dudes have envied him for so long

Oh, Superfly
You're gonna make your fortune by and by
But if you lose, don't ask no questions why
The only game you know is Do or Die
Ah-ha-ha

Hard to understand
What a hell of a man
This cat of the slum
Had a mind, wasn't dumb

But a weakness was shown
'Cause his hustle was wrong
His mind was his own
But the man lived alone

Ooh, Superfly
You're gonna make your fortune by and by
But if you lose, don't ask no questions why
The only game you know is Do or Die
Ah-ha-ha

The game he plays he plays for keeps
Hustlin' times and ghetto streets
Tryin' to get over
That's what he tryin' to do, y'all

Taking all that he can take
Gambling with the odds of fate
Tryin' to get over
Tryin' to get over
Tryin' to get over
Tryin' to get over
Wooh, Superfly

The aim of his role
Was to move a lot of blow
Ask him his dream
What does it mean? He wouldn't know

""Can't be like the rest""
Is the most he'll confess
But the time's running out
And there's no happiness

Ooh, Superfly
You're gonna make your fortune by and by
But if you lose, don't ask no questions why

I push a pen until half past ten
I watch the clock there on the wall
Tic toc, why don't you call
The boss come in and walks down the aisles
He turns around but he never smiles
He watches me just like a hawk
And then he says we must talk

You move me, from side to side
You move me and if feels so right
You move me up and down
You move me around and around

Son, he says (what) I've got bad news
Life is hard and you got the blues
I know you're good and I know you work hard
I'm sorry, son, but here are your cards
I went home and kicked off my shoes
And I asked myself why do I always lose
But then you called and everything was fine
I'm so glad that you are mine

You move me, from side to side
You move me and if feels so right
You move me up and down
You move me around and around

You're the one thing in my life
That makes me feel so good inside

Why You love me
Why do I , why do I, why do I ever wonder why
With all the ways You've shown me
Just how small I am and how tall You are
And where I was before, and I say
Why do I, why do I , why do I ever wonder why

Thomas Dolby,Screen Kiss,"Miller time at the bar where all the English meet
She used to drink in the hills
Only now she drinks in the valleys
Where every road has a name like Beechwood Avenue
Or so it seems
A Croydon girl could really hope to find a home
But with a thousand miles of real estate to choose from
You begin to see the value of your freedom...

The moon is bright in the haze above old Hollywood
And deer look down from the hills
And it's three o'clock in the morning
Pill in hand you can hear his golden surfer boys
Crying out, ""Mummy won't come out of the bathroom!""
And you'd hoped he'd say he's sorry if he hit you
But he's buried in the screenplay of his feature

Screen kiss, one screen kiss
Straight from a film I forget who was in
Screen kiss, one screen kiss
Blue filter lens in a pool of vaseline
But all the rushes look the same
Only there's a movie I wouldn't pay to see again
If it's the one with him in

You and I could be a mile above the earth tremors
Hold to me and we'll climb
You could sneak out while he's sleeping
Suicide in the hills above old Hollywood
Is never gonna change the world
Change the world overnight
Any more than the invention of the six-gun--child--
Any more than the discovery of radium,
Or California tipping in the ocean

Screen kiss, one screen kiss
Straight from a film I forget who was in
Screen kiss, one screen kiss

You wanna touch cause I'm just that tight 
We can roll, we can stroll but I gotta let you know

Only a baller in fact can keep me in the minks 
To the small of my back, I'm just keeping it real 
Letting y'all know from the gate, no papes, no scrapes 
You ain't hungry for it, no plates 
Mother fucker you'll get clowned first 
Treat you like a corner scrub slinging an ounce of dirt 
Think about it, what sound worse?

A smart bitch, fuck with no trick niggas 
Them grimy bitches fuck with stick niggas 
And a dumb bitch just fuck you for your dick nigga

It Dies Today,Sixth of June,"Been waiting for an end in a life filled with all those little stories
(Say what you want, say what you need)
Our last encounter...
(Say what you want, say what you need)
Stung of alcohol...
And all the stones and prison bars that stand in the way of my amends

Forgive me!

I know you killed for me... you're sailing with the rock, Aileen
Promise you'll come for me, the sixth of June will bring you home
Say what you want, say what you need
Because tonight is your last chance to reach me

Hope and love seem to...
(Say what you want, say what you need)
Be a waste in this mortal reality

So we'll meet again on the sixth of June
There won't be a heart to break this time
And all the souls of fallen men can't stand in the way of our love again

Forgive me!

I know you killed for me... you're sailing with the rock, Aileen
Promise you'll come for me, the sixth of June will bring you home
Say what you want, say what you need
Because tonight is your last chance to reach me

I know you killed for me... you're sailing with the rock, Aileen
Promise you'll be back on the sixth of June, our Lord will guide you home
Say what you want, say what you need
Because tonight is your last chance to reach me

I know you killed for me... you're sailing with the rock, Aileen
Promise you'll come for me, the sixth of June will bring you home
Say what you want, say what you need

Dean Martin,Pennies From Heaven,"Every time it rains
Pennies from heaven
Don't you know each cloud contains
Pennies from heaven

You'll find your fortune falling
All over town
Be sure that your umbrella
Is upside down
Trade them for a package of
Sunshine and flowers
And if you want the things you love
You must have showers
So when you hear it thunder
Don't run under a tree
They'll be pennies from heaven
For you and me",sad,1997
Emperor,In the Wordless Chamber,"in the wordless chamber
they feared death
desperately
thus they clustered to the fruits of the earth
craving dispersion
as if to avoid knowing why

in the wordless chamber
they feared life
desperately
thus they proclaimed any given truth
and swallowed
as if to justify their fear

he knew that there had been hordes of seers
before him
who set out to cure
though, the sick wished not to part with
their decease
as if it made them feel
alive

and the unpredictable manifestations

Tells of the women of the sea
They ran from opression
In the forgotten history

No innocents
No leaders to defend
No god, no government
And it's hard to believe
They were riders on the sea

Women of fortune
Always to be prepared to die
Blood on a knife edge
Flag of the sea lord flying high

A world of action strong and free
Adventure war and loyalty
The mermaid tyrant loved to fight
She ties the noods and pulls it tight

Treacherous island
Somewhere to hide on no man's land
Ships in the harbour
Waiting to hear the battle plan",sad,2008

All the things you think we've got

We're not on our own in that way
When we're alone it's real tough going

The Rolling Stones,Fortune Teller,"Went to the fortune teller
To have my fortune read
I didn't know what to tell her
I had a dizzy feeling in my head 

Siad she'd take a look at my palm
She said ""Son, you feel kinda warm""
And she looked into her crystal ball
Said ""You're in love"" 

Said it could not be so
Not with all the girls I know
She said when the next one arrives
Looking into her eyes 

I left there in a hurry
Looking forward to my big surprise
The next day I discovered
That the fortune teller told me a lie 

I hurried back down to that woman
As mad as I could be
I told her I didn't see nobody
Why'd she make a fool out of me 

Then something struck me
As if it came from up above
While looking at the fortune teller
I fell in love 

Now I'm a happy fellow
Well I'm married to the fortune teller
We're happy as we can be
Now I get my fortune told for free 

Now I'm a happy fellow
Well I'm married to the fortune teller
We're happy as we can be

Some I've forgotten I suppose
One or two still linger, oh, and I wonder now
Why I ever let them go?

And a world full of strangers turn their eyes to me

Into rivers of purgatory

The formless fires of Amenti unfold

Not nearly as frenzied as disorder that I bring

Is it the renaissance of my rigid existence?
Is there a future for me beyond the stars?

And too high to see below 
Just hangin' on your daily dose 

I know you never needed anyone 
But the rolling papers for your grass 
How can you give what you don't have 

You keep on aiming for the top 
And quit before you sweat a drop 
Feed your empty brain 
With your hydroponic pot 
Start out playing with yourself 
You get more fun within your shell 
Nice to meet you but I gotta go my way 

I'll leave again 'cause I've been waiting in vain 
But you're so in love with yourself 
If I say my heart is sore 
Sounds like a cheap metaphor 
So I won't repeat it no more 

I rather eat my soup with a fork 
Or drive a cab in New York 
'Cause to talk to you is harder work 

So what's the point of wasting all my words 
If it's just the same or even worse 
Than reading poems to a horse 

You keep on aiming for the top 
And quit before you sweat a drop 
Feed your empty brain 
With your hydroponic pot 
I bet you'll find someone like you 
'Cause there's a foot for every shoe 
And I wish you luck but I've other things to do 

I'll leave again 'cause I've been waiting in vain 
But you're so in love with yourself 
If I say my heart is sore 
Sounds like a cheap metaphor 
So I won't repeat it no more

Tomorrow there'll be so much to do
So tonight I'll drift in a dream with you

How long do you want to be loved?
Is forever enough, is forever enough?
How long do you want to be loved?
Is forever enough?
'Cause I'm never, never giving you up

As you wander through this troubled world
In search of all things beautiful
You can close your eyes when you're miles away
And hear my voice like a serenade

How long do you want to be loved?
Is forever enough, is forever enough?
How long do you want to be loved?
Is forever enough?
'Cause I'm never, never giving you up

How long do you want to be loved?
Is forever enough, is forever enough?
How long do you want to be loved?
Is forever enough?

Wyclef Jean,Something About Mary,"Yo, I'm a dedicate this to everybody that was at Woodstock '99
DMX, Limp Bizkit, Sheryl Crow amongst many
Yo, just before I got on stage this chick came on to me
She offered me sumthin
It looked kinda strange, it was in a bag
I said ""Yo, girl let me talk to you real quick""
Yo

I don't sniff cocaine 'cause it mess up my brain
For sexual stimulation I never did no ecstasy
I don't pop pills, I never did no LSD
but I wouldn't mind a kiss from Ms. Mary
'Cause

She's homegrown and you can hold her in her backyard
She's homegrown and you can get a kiss in her backyard

I remember when I was a young boy
I waited for my grandad, ""So daddy can I get a puff?""
He looked at me, he says ""Son, man, you're too young kid""
""When you get older now and you understand that""
""I let you get one kiss from Ms. Mary""
'Cause

She's homegrown and you can grow her in her backyard
She's homegrown and you can hold her in her backyard
If she allows you to you can roll her up
She's homegrown and you can kiss her in her backyard
She's homegrown - I like to be with you Ms. Mary - in your backyard

That's when she looked at me and she said 
""Wyclef this' what I want you to do son""

Come on 
Inhale - exhale
Exhale - inhale
Inhale - exhale
Now hold it now
Inhale - exhale
Inhale - exhale
Exhale - inhale
Now breath in my face

Marijuan' Marijuan'

She said that
She's homegrown and you can grow her in her backyard
She's homegrown, she said ""'Clef, I'll kiss you in my backyard""
And my daddy don't need to know
She said that
I'm homegrown and you can grow me in your backyard
I'm homegrown and you don't need to worry for my backyard

That's when I said, ""I'ma get in trouble, I gotta go girl""
This' what she said
Laa la-laa laa laa, strictly la-la, to take me higher, and higher {2X}
Laa la-laa laa laa, strictly la-la, to take me higher

I'm about to take it higher {4X - in the background}

Phil Collins,That's What You Said  (LP Version),"I remember the night you weren't at home
(had to work late is what I heard)
That's what you said
I can never forget the way it felt,
you needed some time to work it out,
that's what you said
and now I feel a fool.

'Cos late at night I call your name,
I'm wondering what for,
'cos I've seen those other guys
sniffin' around your door.

Whatever happened to the words
'Lovers for all eternity?'
That's what you said,
I was your rome, you were my Juliet,
eternally
that's what you said
and now I feel a fool.

'Cos late at night I hear your voice
calling out my name,
oh I know it's just a dream
but every night's the same.

I carried a torch for you, through the thick and thin
you know it don't seem right that I won't see you again
No no

Late at night I call your name,
I'm wondering what for,
'cos I keep seeing those other guys
sniffin' around your door.

I carried a torch for you through the wind and rain
I'll never forget you, but I won't see you again
No no

I thought your friends all liked me
I thought I fitted in just right,
that's what you said.
Soon I'll be gone and you'll be free,
you can go find the things that you want.
That's what you said

'cos late at night I still call your name,
I'm wondering what for,

Phil Collins,I Cannot Believe It's True,"When I opened your letter yesterday
I could not believe my eyes
'Cos I've already given all I have to give

I gave it all, it's gone
And I gave it all to you
Now I'm living on borrowed time, but it's mine

Oh, d'you hear me?
I cannot believe it's true
Are you really doing the things you do?
No I cannot believe it's you, really you

Oh these people I'm talking to don't understand
They don't seem to realize
They're listening, but they're not hearing me
They're being too cruel to be kind
Any kind of feeling that I had is gone
'Cos I gave it all, it's gone
And I gave it all to you
Now I'm living on borrowed time, but it's mine

Oh, d'you hear me?
I cannot believe it's true
Are you really doing the things you do?
No I cannot believe it's you, really you

Over and over I keep on telling myself
Over and over I hope I'm gonna wake up
Over and over I know it's really happening
And there's nothing that I can say
'Cos nothing can change all the things that you do to me
Nothing can make me stay

Oh, 'cos you know I cannot believe it's true
Are you really doing the things you do
No I cannot believe it's you, really you

I know it's a crying shame, it's all the same to you
It seems all so well laid out but I cannot get through
Never meant it to show
It started happening, that's all you know.

Oh, I gave it all to you
Now I'm living on borrowed time, but it's mine

Oh, d'you hear me?
I cannot believe it's true
Are you really doing the things you do?
No I cannot believe it's you, really you

Over and over I keep on telling myself
Over and over I hope I'm gonna make up
But over and over I know it's really happening
And there's nothing that I can say

Nothing can make me stay

Finds one boy in back
That she can always stand behind

People look through everything they see
Cuz there's so many other things to be

I wanted to know why you were crying
I wanna fix what's wrong...

It must be love the sailor sails for
Must be love that drives a bottle to the bottom of the ocean floor
Because I imagine all kinds of wonderful water
I would have you there wherever I'll go
Way from the seventh sea,
He brings the bottle back to me
Oh, It Must Be Love
Oh, It Must Be Love
People look through evervthing thev see
There's so many other things to be
I have seen you walking in the rain
I want to know whv vou were crying
Baby, let me fix what's wrong...

It must be love that fathoms the moonlight
Must be love that shallovvs
The deepest part of the night
So you can show them vvith vour eye
The things that make them cry,

But I can't bare to touch you now

She holds a drink, she holds a dream

Someone to despise

Waking up, going on

You don't have to call me lieutenant Rosie and I don't want to be your son

Dynamite's in the belfry playin' with the bats

I'm comin' to liberate you, confiscate you, I want to be your man

Because a record company Rosie just gave me a big advance

And my tires were slashed and I almost crashed but the Lord had mercy
And my machine she's a dud out stuck in the mud somewhere in the swamps of Jersey
Well, hold on tight, stay up all night 'cause Rosie I'm comin' on strong
By the time we meet the morning light I will hold you in my arms

Jessica Simpson,Take My Breath Away,"Watchin' every motion 
In this foolish lovers game 
On this endless ocean 
Finally lovers know no shame 
Turnin' and returnin' 
To some secret place inside 
Watchin' in slow motion 
As you turn around and say 
My love 

Take my breath away 
Take my breath away 

Watchin' I keep waiting 
Still anticipatin' love 
Never hesitatin' 
To become the fated ones 
Turnin' and returnin' 
To some secret place inside 
Watchin' in slow motion 
As you turn around and say 
My love 

Take my breath away 
Take my breath away 

Through the hourglass I saw you 
In time you slipped away 
When the mirror crashed I called you 
And turned to hear you say 
If only for today 
I am unafraid 

Take my breath away 
You take my breath away 
You take my breath 
You take my breath 
You take my breath 
Away 
You take my breath away (repeat til' fade)",happy,2004

My love has been untrue she's found somebody new it's been a blue blue day for me
Well I feel like crying dying what can I do
I feel like praying saying I'm glad we're through
It's been a blue blue day I feel like runnin' away I feel like runnin' away from the blues

Yes how can I make believe that I don't sit and grieve it's been a blue blue day for me
I can't pretend and say that I don't love her anyway it's been a blue blue day for me

Alicia Keys,If I Was Your Woman,"(Talking) Hey Yo, Mo B, Drop it on me. 
Yeah, yeah let's do it like this 

If I was your woman 
And you were my man 
You'd have no other woman 
You'd be weak as a lamb. 
If you had the strength. 
To walk out my door. 
My love would overrule my sense. 
And I'd call you back for more. 
If I was your woman 
If I was your woman 
And you were my man, yeahhh 
She tears you down darling 
Says you're nothing at all 
But I'll pick you up darling 
When she lets you fall 
Cause, You're like a diamond 
But she treats you like glass 
Yet you beg her to love you 
For me you won't ask 

If I was your woman 
If I was your woman 
If I was your woman 
Here's what I'd do 
I'd never, never, no, no, stop lovin you. 
Yeahhhhhhh, Yeah, mmm hmm 


Life is so crazy 
And love is unkind 
Because she was first darling 
Will she hang on your mind? 
You're a part of me 
But you don't even know it 
I'm what you need 
But I'm too afraid to show it 

If I was your woman 
If I was your woman

Mariah Carey,Clown,"I should've left it at, how ya doin'
I should've left it at
I like your music too, and
I should've never called you back
When you pursued me
I should've never given you
My fucking N two way
I should've never listened
To your woeful stories
The ones I'm sure you
Told a thousand times before me
You should've never intimated
We were lovers
When you know very well
We never even touched each other

Who's gonna love you when
It all falls down, and
Who's gonna love you when
Your bankroll runs out
Who's gonna care when the novelty's over
When the star of the
Show isn't you anymore
Nobody cares when the tears of a clown
Fall down...

goes a-round comes back around)
Nobody cares when the tears of a clown
Fall down...

I gotta break it to ya delicately, ""dunny""
Takin' my G5 twenty minutes wasn't nothin'
But I guess you wouldn't know
That's the way I roll
Consequently now your ego's fully
Overblown
You don't want the world to know
That you're just a puppet show
And the little boy inside
Often sits at home alone
And cries, cries, cries, cries
(Boo hoo... Who?)

Who's gonna love you
When it all falls down, and
Who's gonna love you
When your bankroll runs out
(When your bankroll runs out)
Who's gonna care when the novelty's over
When the star of the
Show isn't you anymore
Nobody... (Nobody!...)
Nobody

Your pain is so deep rooted
What will your life become
Sure you hide it 
But you're lost and lonesome
Still just a frail shook one

Who's gonna love you
When it all falls down, and
(Tell me who's gonna love you? Who? I'd like to know)
Who's gonna love you when
Your bankroll runs out
(If you didn't have nothing)
Who's gonna care when the novelty's over
(Who, who'd still be there)
When the star of the show isn't you anymore
(Nobody, nobody, nobody, oh)
Nobody cares when the tears of a clown
(There ain't nobody baby)
Fall down...
(I guess your mama never told you what
goes around comes back around)
(Bullies in the schoolyard)
(When they fall they fall hard)
Nobody cares when the tears of a clown
(Yeah... so you)
Fall down
(I guess your mama never told you what
goes around comes back around)
(Better think twice, better play nice)
('Cause who's gonna be there)

Who's gonna love you when it all falls down, and
(When the jokes on you)
Who's gonna love you when your bankroll runs out
(A marionette show)
Who's gonna care when the novelty's over
(Who's makin' you move though)
When the star of the show isn't you anymore
(I know what kills you slow)
Nobody cares when the tears of a clown
(I'm gonna keep your little secret though)
Fall down
(I guess your mama never told you what
goes around comes back around)
( mmmm, hmmmm)
(And you know that I know)
Nobody cares when the tears of a clown

Fall down...

Kane,All I Can Do,"May all of your wishes
Come true for life
And all that you wait for
Be true for life
All that you long for
May all of it shine
Bright as the sunlight

And so much for anger
So much for gain
May all that you're after
Be conquered with grace
May all that you reach for
Be worthy and true
And guard you a lifetime

And cry tears of laughter
You will cry tears of pain
But all of that hurting 
And the heartbreaking
It will guide your way
All you've created
May all of it stand
Proudly through ages

And come back again
Come back again

you pulled away
But you wanted me to stay
Instead you ran away

Because I gave you everything I had to give
If you know it's worth the fight
We gotta compromise
Baby, talk to me
And tell me what's wrong
Come sit down next to me
And let me feel the vibe you're on
Come lay your head on me
And everything will be alright
But we must communicate
Tomorrow it could be too late

Gang Starr,Mostly Tha Voice (Explicit),"Refrain:

It's mostly tha voice, that gets you up
It's mostly tha voice, that makes you buck
A lot of rappers got flavor, and some got skills
But if your voice ain't dope then you need to (chill... chill... )

Up steps one, and he gets done
Then up steps another, he gets smothered
That's word to mother, or should I say moms
I drop bombs, scorchin niggaz like napalm
Sucka, boy, get off my shit
Get off my dick so what I make butter hits
You better change your behavior, battling Gangstarr
No religion could save ya
My religion is rap, R-A-P
R-E-A-L-I-T-Y, G
Cause when I rock street kids rejoice
I got mad rhymes, still

Refrain

So when you think you know the whole you don't even know the half
You're not a threat to myself, and neither to my staff
Not the type to really dance too much, although I used to
Rather bust a fresh line, and get loose to
The blunted ill types of beats Premier makes
Makes your girl's rear shake, let me set it straight

Refrain

Some rappers use hooks to this shit
But if you took that shit out
and you took all the music out
What would remain?  The voice no doubt
Bless my soul I control
when in pimp mode
My bank roll expands
I invest in my man
I plan, to keep rap real
so if your shit ain't fat then kneel
You squeal, feeling pain from my oral flex
what about oral sex, which chick's next
To open wide and get a chunk from a real brother
Yeah, some real funk from a real brother
They get sprung and most of them don't recover
But I don't diss em I just talk to em
Cause the sound, of my voice, it does a lot to em
So you and, the niggaz right there
Be aware, like SWV, I'm right here
Waitin to correct your ass
And if you don't follow now I'll disrespect your ass
More Vicious than Sid, do a crime with no bid
I tell a bitch that I didn't when you know that I did
Take a trip to a land a-far
Then come back, and people still know Gangstarr
See I'm the ladies choice
Cause I got crazy styles, still

Refrain

Outro: Guru, Shug

Oh shit Shug, whattup

Just loungin, about to go do this shit in the studio

You always said I could get on, you need to let me get on that)

Dilated Peoples,World On Wheels,"[Verse 1]
Yo I grew up in Mid-City near World on Wheels
After Reaganomics crack came and more blood spill
I gotta tell shorties now I don't pop pills
The only ecstacy I fuck with rolls with Jalil
No grip, straight line rhymes
Like the grand concourse on 149
In LA the riders ridge was Fairfax and Olympic ???
On the block the Ethiopians kick it (salaam)
You'll learn Angel City'll test you
I move through giving respect where respect's due
Ducking these cops who say they serve to protect you
And handlin my biz so I ain't tryin to impress you
It's mind over matter, crew over money
I do strategy, I don't act sporadically
I contemplate, cat I move mathematically
It's Alchemist with Dilated, that's family

[Chorus]
Still a couple lessons I can teach
How the real fiends cop two each
The game is keeping dope in the streets
So look the world on wheels
Still a couple lessons I can teach
How the real heads rock real beats
Bangin out the illest rides on the streets
Look at the world on wheels

[Verse 2]
Peace King, peace haki, peace queen

I only leave em in pieces if they step in the ring
They're fumbling and wondering what weapon to bring
I'm like Ice-T, I know my lethal weapon'll swing
Stop the presses, block the doors
Cops oppress us, watch the wolves
But all the friendly fire is worse than oppression
Pressure more stressin is poured in dead presidents (Rakaa)
Fights for your rights is my pleasure
But suckers swing rulers like swords that try to measure
While Slick Rick the ruler's at war with INS yo
I hope the young fly their best yo
Hip-hop desert again, it's like Busy Bee's buzzin again
My patience is thin though
I ventilate em like I cracked the window and air it out like a Hail Mary to the end zone

[Chorus]

When I'm all out, I cause panic (peace summits)
When I move stealth (it's mysteries and who-done-its)
I made mental notes of who's fam and who frontin
Mental notes of who ran shit and who runnin
It's mind over matter, crew over money
I do strategy, I don't act sporadically
I contemplate, cat I move mathematically
Create to devastate crew, that's family

Slipknot,Gently (Album Version),"Gently, my mind escapes into the relaxing world of pleasure...
A pleasure that'll take my mind off the reality of my life...
My past life...
Life as I know it now!

And whatever may come, it slowly disappears!
To somewhere in the back of my mind...
It will remain there... 'til I wish to retrieve it!




Yes, I will stay here for awhile, for I need the break!
A break from the pressures of life!
And everything that lays in the palm of life's hands!
Life's hands!



This mode is incredible! It's out of this world!
Too bad I must always leave it...

That's life

The Ataris,I Won't Spend Another Night Alone,"A star up in the sky goes slowly passing by
The lights below...they spell out your name.
You're comfort on my mind and you're with me all the time.
And lots of feelings that I can't explain.

I won't spend another night alone.
I won't spend another night alone.

Out of every girl I meet, no other can compete
I'd ditch 'em all for a night with you.
I know you don't believe you mean this much to me
But I promise you that you do.

If I had one wish this is what it would be...
I'd ask you to spend all your time with me,
That we'd be together forever.
We'd buy a small house in south central L.A.
Raise lots of kids then we'd both join a gang
Just as long as we're together.

The things you make me wanna do
I'd rob a quik-e mart for you
I'd go to the pound and let all the cats go free
Just as long as you'd be with me.

I won't spend another night alone.
I won't spend another night alone.

Dropkick Murphys,Going Strong (Album Version),"There's a brand new century about to begin and the kids
Of the 90's are paving' the path, for the youth of America,
Free at last from the violence and destruction that destroyed our name,
Whenever there was trouble we took the blame.
But now our scene's alive with a new generation of American kids.

[Chorus:]
We work hard now lets enjoy the fruits of what we've done, tomorrow may never come.
The kids on the street will have their say now - Because!

We've had enough of these negative comparisons a new breed of kids.
Brought together by a movement and a sense of tradition the strong will survive.
And together our backs can never be broken cause now our scene's alive
With a new generation of American kids.

Belle and Sebastian,I Could Be Dreaming,"I could be sleeping
I could be dreaming
I could have ordinary people chasing me from town to town
Mission Impossible
They've got a spy for every blink of your eye

I'm feeling awkward
I'm feeling tongue-tied
They've got a knife for every time you take the same train into work
A family's like a loaded gun
You point it in the wrong direction someone's gonna get killed

If you had such a dream
Would you get up and do the things you believed in?

Is he your husband?
Or just your boyfriend?
Is he the moron who's been beating you and keeping you inside?
I've never done this kind of thing
But if I kill him now, well who's going to miss him?

I went up to the school
I took a walk up Castlehill
For every step there was a local boy who wants to be a hero
Do you wanna do it now?
Outside the butcher's with a knife and a bike chain

If you had such a dream
Would you get up and do the things you believed in?

If you had such a dream
Would you get up and do those things?

If you had such a dream
Would you get up and do those things?

While your head is clear
While your head is clear
While your head is clear

Woman speaking in background (from ""Rip Van Winkle"" by Washington Irving):

""Times grew worse and worse with Rip Van Winkle as years of matrimony rolled on; a tart tempter never mellows with age, and a sharp tongue is the only edge tool that grows keener by constant use. For a long while he used to console himself, when driven from home, by frequenting a kind of perpetual club of the sages, philosophers, and other idle personages of the village, which held its sessions on a bench before a small inn, designated by a rubicund portrait of his majesty George the Third. Here they used to sit in the shade, through a long lazy summer's day, talking listlessly over village gossip, or telling endless sleepy stories about nothing. But it would have been worth any statesman's money to have heard the profound discussions that sometimes took place, when by chance an old newspaper fell into their hands, from some passing traveller. How solemnly they would listen to the contents, as drawled out by Derrick Van Bummel, the schoolmaster, a dapper learned little man, who was not to be daunted by the most gigantic word in the dictionary...""",happy,1996

You belong in a boat out at sea
Sail away, kill off the hours

Go away somewhere all bright and new

Who compares with you

You belong among the wildflowers
You belong in a boat out at sea
You belong with your love on your arm
You belong somewhere you feel free

Run away, go find a lover
Run away, let your heart be your guide
You deserve the deepest of cover
You belong in that home by and by

You belong among the wildflowers
You belong somewhere close to me
Far away from your trouble and worry
You belong somewhere you feel free

Annie Lennox,A Whiter Shade Of Pale,"We skipped the light Fandango
Turned cartwheels 'cross the floor
I was feeling kind of seasick
But the crowd called out for more
The room was humming harder
As the ceiling flew away
When we called out for another drink
The waiter brought a tray

And so it was that later
As the Miller told his tale
That a face at first just ghostly
Turned a whiter shade of pale

She said there is no reason
And the truth is plain to see
But I wandered through my playing cards
And would not let her be
One of sixteen vestal virgins
Who were leaving for the coast
And although my eyes were open
They might just as well've been closed

And so it was later
As the Miller told his tale
AThat a face at first just ghostly
Turned a whiter shade of pale

And so it was later
As the Miller told his tale
That a face at first just ghostly
Turned a whiter shade of pale

Or you don't really wanna see me fly? 

Do you really wanna hurt Mase? 
Or do you really wanna make me cry? 
Or is it really that you envy Mase?
Or you don't really wanna see me fly? 

Now you don't wanna see me angry
Ain't enough cops or cuffs to chain me
Days to arraign me, KKK's to hang me, insane me
Ya need ice picks to bang me
Need more than a straight jacket to restrain me
Or more guns with my prints for you to frame me and mame me
Nigga, look at you and look at us
My duns don't fuss, Harlem win you with a thrush
Nigga you better hush, I can mess out the cave 
Niggas still get touched
And them little ones you bust ain't enough for us
Listen here, Mase'll make you disappear
And yo' mouth'll be the reason that you missed this year
Man who needs ya? You don't need me, I don't need you neither
That's why my next Lex gon' be a two seater
And the things I do to you won't leave you beautiful
And though yo' feelin' fuck me, I'm feelin' mutual 

[Repeat 1]

From the M to the A nigga dollar sign E
Come around money if you ever tryin' to find me
I was murder for six years, seen no clean from it
Drop murder off, Mase woke up at Teen Summit
My niggas joke, niggas broke, kill a laugh
I got power, make a call, get a mil' in cash
Like my money and ya ain't cuz they don't tax me
Actually, anything you got to ask me, fax me
I'm no Beamer dreamer, I'm a Bentley man
Car totally smashed threw out 50 grand
How ya figure ya bigger when Mase that nigga
And every style I deliver come with much charisma
Knock it off, now will ya , I'm the one that bitches live for
Don't get me wrong you niggas make it hot I make it sizzler
And I don't know you cats, so don't you get familiar
And if you violate me and mine I guarentee I peel ya

[Repeat 1]

If I ever whisper on a remix, I got C-chips
Time is money, when you talk gotta be quick
I don't see how ya'll hang or even be wit
Niggas ridin' in the Benz with only one V-6
But I know how it is when ya go into the bar
Got girls overreact, they thowin' you a star 
Got niggas player hatin' don't even know who you are
And go as far as leavin' bullet holes in yo' car
When you're from Harlem World niggas never see yo' views
They wait for you to flop or be on BET News
All they see the G's and jewels, V's that ya cruise
Being the underdogs, they can't wait to see us lose
Don't hate me, thank me
I don't get mad when nigga's bitches prank me
Make you cranky to see me places that you can't be
I'm too pretty to let you niggas shank me 
And frankly, know you probably hate me cause you ain't me

And whisper wholeheartedly
The creed of Hades and beyond
As I succumb to inevitable sin

For I cannot enslave myself
With imaginary words of salvation
The hypocrisy that surrounds my temple
Is assisted by pretenders to the throne

The winds that blow purity
Signify my chosen legacy
I was born to opposition
A contender to creation

In Sorte Diaboli
In Sorte Diaboli
In Sorte Diaboli
In Sorte Diaboli

For my sins
I will ask no forgiveness
For my sins
They are not to forgive

So never speak of me quietly
Stand by my confession
I voice your rebellion
Against the traitor of the world

I am the first creature of this kingdom
I will be the one
To out live his time
With the triumph of free will",sad,2007

Petra,Hollow Eyes (Beat The System Album Version),"Another day in Nigeria the children beg for bread, 
The crops failed, the well ran dry 
When they lost the watershed 

A baby dies, its mother cries, the children gather 'round 
They're wondering what the day will bring 
Will they be the next one found? 

(Chorus) 
Do you dare to gaze into their hollow eyes, hollow eyes? 
Are they staring holes in you with their hollow eyes, 
Hollow eyes, hollow eyes? 

In the crowded sheds the children lay their heads 
To escape the Haitian heat 
The hunger pains drive them to the street 
Wond'ring if today they'll eat 
Some find food in the refuse heap, others find disease 
Some find it harder just to live when they can die with ease. 

The least of these is hungry. 
The least of these is sick. 
The least of these needs clothing. 
The least of these needs drink. 
The least of these knows sorrow. 
The least of these knows grief. 
The least of these has suffered pain, and Jesus is His name.

Got to let your eyes adjust
I'm sorry about your suit
Can't do nothing about the dust
Welcome down underground
Hunker down a spell
Gets to feel like home to me 
Though I know it looks like hell

Down in the hole
Lord, it's deep and the sides are steep
And the nights are long and cold
Down in the hole
Light and love and the world above
Mean nothing to the mole
(Don't mean nothing to the mole)

Never gets real hot down here
Fifty five degrees
It's always a little bit damp, I fear
But I've never seem to freeze
Mushrooms and earthworms
Fancy stuff to eat
A world of quiet contemplation (Oh, yes)
Just below the street

Down in the hole
Lord, it's deep and the sides are steep
And the nights are long and cold
Down in the hole
Light and love and the world above
Mean nothing to the mole

I'm in a hole
Since I lost my baby
Living in a hole
Since I lost my girl

Would you play in the moonlight
Would you dance in the dirt
Come home way past daybreak
Cockleburs all stuck in your shirt
Come back home to twilight
Come back home to me
Subterranean river you are
Meets the molten sea

Down in the hole
Lord, it's deep and the sides are steep
And the nights are long and cold
Down in the hole
Light and love and the world above
They show nothing to the mole

Down in the hole
Light and love and the world above
Got nothin' for the mole
Ain't got nothin' 
For the mole

Look out for that
Look out for that
Look out for that root
Look out for that root

Welcome down underground
Welcome",sad,1991

And for my worthy niggaz I'ma die tryin for y'all
With the blessing of an angel's tear cryin' for y'all
Back to the foundation, takin you under back where it all started
With a whole new beginnin and a brand new hunger
Starvin to where my skin was suffocatin my ribs
Now we got bitches interior decoratin my crib
Touch the love I got like you holdin my heart in my hand
And watch my manifesto, shit was all a part of the plan
The fashion that I choose to deal with this shit
Sometimes it's so hard to describe the passion that I feel for this shit
How many struggles I survived just to eat this meal
Never thought y'all meet a nigga that could be this real

Too late for turnin back my nigga cause we takin it there

Strictly raw shit is what niggaz be seekin me for
Testin my strength, that's what the devil's try to weaken me for
C'mon, yes and y'all off to the next step.. for sure
Rep and make you wanna accept more
Niggas analyze the jewel that I reveal in a rhyme
I'm like somethin that has evolved about a million times
Peep the display with all the new features
The way we really doin it, these mu'fuckas probably wouldn't believe us
Flipmode Squad by all means, a pledge of allegiance
With the great feelin of people like the comin of Jesus
While a lot of other niggaz don't be tellin you nothin
That be the same bullshit that's always pushin my buttons
Godly is how we rep this undeniable force
You like a weak preacher, swearin smacked dead on a cross
Kick niggaz like the two back legs of a horse
Chop ya fingers for tryin' to put your hands in the sauce
Sometimes I think that it would be best if you run
And do yourself a favor, cause you got your whole life ahead of you son!
A whole new thang startin for me
Smell so much ass in a spot, the beat got the world fartin for me
When I spit you know I always love to garnish it hard
While you love-it hate-it niggaz trying to tarnish the God
I know some dudes that would love to bring the hatred to y'all
While I continue to bless you with shit that's is sacred to y'all
Even if I had to bend you in place
I always put it down and rep my niggaz from the most genuine place
From my street corner niggaz to my live niggaz everywhere
Too late for turning back, we takin it there

Bob Dylan,Trying To Get To Heaven,"The air is getting hotter
There's a rumbling in the skies
I've been wading through the high muddy water
With the heat rising in my eyes

Every day your memory grows dimmer
It doesn't haunt me like it did before
I've been walking through the middle of nowhere
Tryin' to get to heaven before they close the door

When I was in Missouri
They would not let me be
I had to leave there in a hurry
I only saw what they let me see

You broke a heart that loved you
Now you can seal up the book and not write anymore
I've been walking that lonesome valley
Tryin' to get to heaven before they close the door

People on the platforms
Waiting for the trains
I can hear their hearts a-beatin'
Like pendulums swinging on chains

When you think that you've lost everything
You find out you can always lose a little more
I'm just going down the road feeling bad
Tryin' to get to heaven before they close the door

I'm going down the river
Down to New Orleans
They tell me everything is gonna be all right
But I don't know what  even means

I was riding in a buggy with Miss Mary Jane
Miss Mary Jane got a house in Baltimore
I been all around the world, boys
Now I'm tryin' to get to heaven before they close the door

Gotta sleep down in the parlor
And relive my dreams
I'll close my eyes and I wonder
If everything is as hollow as it seems

Some trains don't pull no gamblers
No midnight ramblers, like they did before
I been to Sugartown, I shook the sugar down
Now I'm tryin' to get to heaven before they close the door",sad,1997

Than push my limbs out towards you right there 
My heart is bursting in your perfect eyes 
As blue as oceans and as pure as skies 

I struggle for the words and then give up 
My head's up with the birds on the T hut 
A little peace of mind that I know better 
Than the plain disgrace of all my letters 

But after that the floodgates opened up 
And I fell in love with everyone I saw 
Please take your time, I'm not in any rush 
And it's in everything I ever write 

It's not as if I need the extra weight 
Confused enough by life, so thanks a lot 
Lonely written words for company 
Just raise the roof this once and follow me

Wake up in a cold sweat, this nightmare ain't over yet
Maybe my mind is playing tricks on me
Every portrait in every room
Seems to follow my every move

Another sleepless night, oh woh heavy my mind
Lord I can't escape, my conscienss thought I left it way behind
Oh woh, it's heavy on my mind

Every creak of the door, every foot step I hear
Oh no no. Every hollow of the wind, makes me tremble with fear, with fear

Another sleepless night, oh woh it's heavy my mind
Lord I can't escape, my conscienss the thought I left it way behind
Oh woh, it's heavy on my mind

Heavy on my mind",sad,2007
The Jam,The Modern World,"This is a modern world
This is the modern world

What kind of a fool do you think I am?
You think I know nothing of the modern world
All my life has been the same
I've learned to live by hate and pain
It's my inspiration drive

I've learned more than you'll ever know
Even at school I felt quite sure
That one day I would be on top
And I'd look down upon the map
The teachers who said I'd be nothing

This is the modern world that I've learnt about
This is the modern world, we don't need no one
To tell us what's right or wrong

Say what you like 'cause I don't care
I know where I am and going too
It's somewhere I won't preview
Don't have to explain myself to you
I don't give two fucks about your review",sad,1977
Ann Lee,So deep,"Now if you leave me there's no way to stop you 
If that's the way things have got to be 
Remember this - it's the love that I gave you 
You'll try to say that you cared for me. 

Oh - if you leave me don't ever regret it 
'cos there's no playing with destiny 
Oh - you say enough but you've got to have meant it down deep. 

Because you feel so deep 
Oh yes you feel so deep 
There's nothing left for me 
Because you feel so deep. 

Well if you go there is no way to argue 
If that's the way that your mind is made 
I feel the sadness of knowing I failed you 
But that won't change a decision made. 

Oh if you go just look back on what I told you 
That if you're gone there's no turning back 
Oh you say enough it's because love is cold so deep",sad,2000

George Jones,Ol' Frank,"She was just 17 but she was all woman when Ol' Frank slipped the ring on her hand. My God he was wealthy, owned half of the county, but he'd never see 60 again. After 10 years of Heaven and long nights of love his ole heart couldn't keep up the pace. But friends you can bet that he had no regrets. Ol' Frank ran one Hell of a race.

CHORUS:
She cried all the way to the chapel, like she really cared for Ol' Frank. She cried all the way to the grave where he lay. Then she smiled all the way to the bank.

He had bought her big diamonds and long limousines as she taught him what happiness meant. Lord he spent a fortune on his prized possession. And to him she was worth every cent. Now Ol' Frank is gone and the whole town's still talkin'. They think what she did is a disgrace. There are many who think that she killed poor Ol' Frank but he died with a smile on his face.

She cried all the way to the grave where he lay. Then she smiled all the way to the bank.",sad,1986
Julie Roberts,The Chance,"I found a book that my mama kept
Filled with secrets she hid
And in a dusty old attic, one mornin I read
About a woman I never met
Who had dreams just like mine
With every page that I turned, the words came alive

Wish I could roll out of town like a run-away train
I'll do as I dare, let them call me insane
I'll never sit on the sidelines of life, I'll dance every dance
If I just had the chance

A tear fell on that faded page
Cause this was somebody else
Not the mama I knew who never thought of herself
But the times, they were different then
And lines just didn't get crossed
And these words that she wrote, they somehow got lost

Wish I could roll out of town like a run-away train
I'll do as I dare, let them call me insane
I'll never sit on the sidelines of life, I'll dance every dance
If I just had the chance

The chance that she never had
Is now the gift that is mine
And out here on this road, I'm makin up for lost time
Yeah, I am my mother's child
And tonight in this car
I've got her words in my suitcase and her dreams in my heart

As I roll out of town like a run-away train
I'll do as I dare, let them call me insane
I'll never sit on the sidelines of life, I'll dance every dance
While I still have the chance
I'll never sit on the sidelines of life, I'll dance every dance
While I still have the chance",happy,2004
Natalie Cole,The Gift,"Written by mark davis & marti sharron

Every captain must steer the wheel, not by choice but from the voice

That's in his ear, I have lived long and I've done much wrong

But I've survived through my lies, I'm still here, so all you people

Know what I say is true, that I'm here because of you, I have lived on

Yes I've made it through, you've returned your love to me

Well I felt fire and I got tired of running from the truth



And I let people down, and I wore a crown of being the biggest fool

So all you people know what I say is true, that I'm here because of you

I have lived on, yes I've made it through, you've returned your love to me

There were times I had enough, I almost gave it up

But you reached out your heart to me, look what you've done now

I've become the best, oh, I'm the best I can be, oh, oh, oh

You've returned your love, the gift of love, yes, you gave this gift to me",happy,1985

All this vanity that we could hide

We all ourselves are created

Ourselves we are created
our own gods

When the whole sky is red like blood
Man can realize the real meaning of life
to love and respect your life

Conspiring with the reef
To sink our ship

The wind's a cheating wife
Her tongue a thirsty knife
And she could take your life
With one good kiss

As morning's light breaks over me?
Know tonight we'll make our bed
At the bottom of the sea

I know the ocean speaks (The stars retreat behind their veil)
I've heard her call to me (The clouds are clinging to your sail)
And smiling in my dreams (The storm is coming, can you see?)
She whispers this:

""Can you see the sky turn red
As morning's light breaks over me?
Know tonight we'll make our bed
At the bottom of the sea""

Look and see the sky turn red
Like blood it covers over me
And soon the sea shall give up her dead
We'll raise an empire from the bottom of the sea.",sad,2005

Don't wanna share the anguish
And I will take it away from you
Before you can change it

Like a damned I walk over
Touch the sky when it's burning red 
Standing the ground I have chosen

Shivering in outer space

It's like getting nowhere
Gathering all those fears and fails

Hope for the hopeless and sight for the blind

To all who've been born in the Spirit
And who share incarnation with Him
Who belong to eternity stranded in time
And weary of struggling with sin

Forget not the hope that's before you
And never stop counting the cost

Brian Littrell,Wish,"For just a moment 
I wish I could have been there 
To see Your first step, hear Your very first word 
Tell me, did You ever fall and scrape Your knee? 
Did You know Your wounds would one day heal the world? 

For just one moment 
I wish I could have seen You growing 
Learning the ways of a carpenter's son 
Just a little boy gazing at the stars 
Did You remember creating every one? 

If You passed by, would I have seen a child or a King? 
Would I have known? 

I wish I could have been there 
My only wish is to see You face to face 
Wish I could have been there 
Just to see You, Jesus, face to face 

For just a moment 
I wish I could have been there 
When You left Your footprints upon the waves 
To walk along beside You and never look away 
Just Your whisper and the wind and sea obey 

To see You feed the people 
To feel Your healing in Your touch 

To hear You pray in the garden alone 
Laying down Your will with each tear 
To see You walk that lonely road 
Willing to die for me 
And in that moment 
I know I should have been there 
You took my cross and gave Your life 

And You live again! 
Wish I could have been there 
My only wish is to see You rise again 
Wish I could have been there 
My only wish is to see You, Jesus, face to face 
Someday I'll be there, I'm gonna be there 
I'll see Your face, Your mercy, Your grace 
Someday, someday 
I'm gonna see You, Jesus

Arctic Monkeys,Fake Tales Of San Francisco,"Fake Tales of San Francisco echo through the room
More point to a wedding disco without a bride or groom
There's a super cool band, yeah, with their trilbys and their glasses of white wine
And all the weekend rockstars in the toilets practicing their lines

I don't want to hear you (kick me out, kick me out)
I don't want to hear you, no (kick me out, kick me out)
I don't want to hear you (kick me out, kick me out)
I don't want to hear you, I don't want to hear you

Fake Tales of San Francisco echo through the air
And there's a few bored faces in the back, all wishing they weren't there
And as the microphone squeaks a young girl's telephone beeps
Yeah, she's dashing for the exit, oh, she's running to the streets outside
""Oh, you've saved me"", she screams down the line
""The band were fucking wank and I'm not having a nice time""

I don't want to hear you (kick me out, kick me out)
I don't want to hear you, no (kick me out, kick me out)
Yeah, but his bird said it's amazing, though, so all that's left
Is the proof that love's not only blind but deaf

He talks of San Francisco, he's from Hunter's Bar
I don't quite know the distance but I'm sure that's far
Yeah, I'm sure it's pretty far

And, yeah, I'd love to tell you all my problem
You're not from New York City, you're from Rotherham

Seven Mary Three,Hammer & a Stone,"I'm digging through the darkness
Cause I'm a long wall miner
Following the road down
Just so I can sit beside her
I'm a page torn from your novel
Beneath a magnet on your fridge
I'm a star stuck on your ceiling
So I can watch you while you're sleeping

Do you remember me
Do you remember me because
I wanted you so bad
Do you remember me
Do you remember me because
Everything we had

Was like a hammer to a stone
Wrapped like a fender around a tree
The curiosity in you
And all the emptiness in me

Digging through the vices
I don't know where the inside is
Well here's my dirty little secret
And I bet you, you can't keep it

I'm a page torn from your novel
A single flower in your lawn
If I'm not everything you wished for
How come you miss me when I'm gone?

Do you remember me 
Do you remember me because 
I wanted you so bad 
Do you remember me 
Do you remember me because

Was like a hammer to a stone 
Wrapped like a fender around a tree

Let your heart be light,
From now on our troubles
Will be out of sight.

Have yourself a merry little Christmas,
Make the Yule-tide gay,
From now on our troubles
Will be miles away.

Here we are as in olden days,
Happy golden days of yore,
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more.

We all will be together
If the Fates allow,
Hang a shining star
On the highest bough,
And have yourself

The Smashing Pumpkins,Real Love,"Fall in to the century of supersonic cross
Blessed she in aching silence- eternal loss
Calling out ""I won't surrender""
A locket of her hair
Sympathize her pious pleasures
Go down the stairs into the dark again
To feel alive again, and wait for
Real love
Or is it me you're after
Is it time?
Because it's now or never
Real love
Real love forever
Real love
Born of the ball and chain
Into a world sustained with sorrow
Real love
A real touch we speak in
Is it lies.
Or is what we're seeking
Real love
In the eyes
Behold and you'll find the 21st century
Detonate her will and her widowed speech
Buried in the backyard shadow
The rusty coffee tin
That held her mother's first kiss in a
Nameless dream
Fall down the stairs again
To feel alive against tommorow
Real love
Or is it me you're after
Is it time
Cause it's now or never
Real love
Real love forever
Is it love
Or just yours to treasure
Real love
Real love
Real love
We never listen
Real love will listen
And tell her of my fortune
Real love is riches
Scratch through the changes
Real love is nameless
So tired and hopeless
Real love is painless
Nobody mentions
We ever move to collect
The solar questions
Demon scorn should not relax
The laws of gravity

Rihanna,We Ride,"Ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die
We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die

It's real late, 'bout a quarter to one
Thinking about everything we become
And I hate it
I thought we could make it

But I'm ready to dead this
Just wanna forget about it
I saw her pictures
And the letters she sent

You had me thinking
You were out with your friends
I'm so foolish
Play me like I'm stupid
'Cause I thought it was just you and I

Now I look back on the time
That we spent and I
See it in my mind
Playing over and over again

'Cause boy right now
You got me breaking down
And I just can't figure out why
But this is what you say

We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die
We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die

We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die
We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die

Visions in my mind
Of the day that we met
You showed me things
That I'll never forget

Took me swimming
In the ocean
You had my head up in the clouds
Made me feel like I'm floating
You think I'm playing

When you know it's the truth
Nobody else can do it quite like I do
All my kisses
And my loving
But ain't nobody better than us

Now I look back on the time
That we spent and I
See it in my mind
Playing over and over again
'Cause boy right now
You got me breaking down
And I just can't figure out why

We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die
We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die

We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die
We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die

I guess it's over indefinitely
But you and I know
It's not that easy to let go
Of everything that we planned
And start all over again

Just blame yourself 'cause you blew it
I won't forget how you do it
Sweet baby this is where the game ends now
Somehow wanna believe you and me
We can figure it out

We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die
We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die

You finna make me say boy
I wish that you come hold me
When I'm lonely
When I need someone to talk to

You would phone me
Just like everything you told me
(When we ride we ride, it's till the day we die)
Boy you forgot about the promises you made me
And now we'll let the memories just fade away
But I remember what you used to say
(When we ride we ride, it's till the day we die)

We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die
We ride, when we ride we ride

A new confidence like a new king
Like a breeze levitating
To raise a sunken soul
And to the surface shines like a new pin

What junkie says is not what junkie do
But it's all for you
And the tricks he turns will always shine right through
But it's all for you

Like a dream synchronising
With the one I missed the most
A concentrated love from a new queen
Like a wave stabilising
I walk a tighter rope
And my new victim shines like a new pin
I can feel lies within the
Gospels that I'm sold
The tactless sentiments are a new pain

But it's all for you",sad,2005
Blackalicious,World Of Vibrations (Album Version),"(feat. Ledisi) 

[Gift of Gab] 
We'd like to welcome you all again to the world of vibrations 
Introduction to the nation of revolutionary thoughts 
Hear the sound evolve, expand, and change 
Most of the things that we're sayin' haven't broken through your chatter 
So y'all niggaz still ego trip based and 
Have not begun to taste the kundalini wisdom bliss 
I'm droppin' as a lyric quotin' vessel for the stages 
Play this on your play list 
I like dough 
But musically I'm transcendin' the physical 
And don't blame me for the slang and the words 
God writes these rhymes through me 
I just listen to him 
I'm just livin' duke 
Matrix driven rules haven't fooled me 
Cuz I still think abstract 
And stay metaphysical 
And challenge what is really real 
And keep creatin' with the force to bring rap back 
Not that it's away 
But everybody got somethin' to say 
So let me speak the opposite of what's hot now 
And make that hot 
So it will get exploited 
And the corporation only will back dudes who bite my style 
And they can try and try again 
I've been influenced by a lot of pioneers 
South to the East and West 
But when a hot MC 
Gets on stage with a real MC 
Most of the time the situation gets hostile 

[Chorus: Ledisi] 
We vibrate at higher frequencies 
Welcome to our world and intro to 
Fall into a space 
Where there is no thoughts 
Just moments captured 
Here we go 

We vibrate at higher frequencies 
Let us up inside your head 
Just step inside our world of vibration 
Bump this from your birth to your deathbed 

[Gift of Gab] 
Take time with the pad and the pen to dig within 
In a world of BS that we're livin' in 
To my ears music sound sweet as cinnamon 
So I stay poundin' out tunes and tunes again and again 
In the 5th chapter ladies and gentlemen 
And I still got MCs on my dinner menu 
Write late at night this isn't David Letterman though 
On second thought, I'm like a letter man though 
Let the craft evolve catch a little syndrome 
Shootin' through your vains, vibratin' though your eardrums 
Used to think 30 years old then the end comes 
Now I feel like I'm just gainin' momentum 
Seen the world two times all except for India 
About to vacate there when we finish this one 
Work hard but still some sweep 
We won't mention them 
In fact, they act as fuel for our engine 
Engine engine number 9, mic lynchin' 
When we're done with this these songs are our pension 
MCs are puppets, Me, I'm Jim Henson 
Take a squat or get chopped by the henchmen 
City, town, state arena or convention 
Please believe these the G's that ease pension 
Rakka and Ev said that it's a marathon 
Song after song, we keep on inventin' 

[Chorus] - repeats",happy,2005

David Phelps,One King (Album Version),"In the beginning there was the Word
Pure love was spoken to reach every man
They stopped and listened but all that they heard
Was language that they could not understand
No joy, no peace, no hope in sight

So He came with starlight and love in His eyes
No regal welcome for His infant cries
There have been many babies to become a king
But only one King became a baby

He left behind His throne of pure light
Gave up His crown that we might be free
He chose a manger that Bethlehem night
And reaching through time and space He saw me
With no joy, no peace, no hope in sight

So He came with starlight and love in His eyes
No regal welcome for His infant cries
There have been many babies to become a king
But only one King became a baby

He could have chosen to break through the sky
With anthem and angel wing
But He knew we'd understand a baby's cry
And learn love from a servant King

So He came with starlight and love in His eyes
No regal welcome for His infant cries
There have been so many babies to become a king
Only one King, one King became a baby",sad,2007

For the right raindrop to set 'em free

I thought there was none
That was when I found one
On a dark night in a southern town
You called to me and I turned around
In a perfect moment when the stars aligned
You couldn’t have come at a better time
And every day in my life had led me to
That perfect moment with you

Lucky that we did not meet
Ten years back on the street
So many pages yet to turn
So many dreams still to burn
Oh but I don’t cry for the wasted years
Or the twisted roads that got me here
I have been to the end of the earth
And I know what standing still is worth
In a perfect moment when the stars aligned
Love don’t travel in straight lines
And every day of my life had led me to
That perfect moment with you

Well the wheel of fortune is going round and round
I never thought I would come up when I was down

But a perfect moment when the stars aligned
When you put your hand in mine
And every day of my life has led me to
That perfect moment
Every day of my life has led me to

Nothing but the bare and naked truth

You appear to have it all together
No signs of dementia
I applaud you

You're so perfect
I'm so second rate
No signs of lunacy
Now I cheer for you
I'm glad you know who you are
You'll go far
I applaud you

Should I clap a little louder
I applaud you
Should I cheer a little louder
I applaud you

Your such a winner
You've got what it takes
I know you love the good life
I can relate
I saw you rollin' down the street
In a brand new car
I applaud you

Should I clap a little louder
I applaud you
Should I cheer a little louder
I applaud you

I'm so jealous of your looks
You overflow with charisma
No signs of insecurity
You overflow with charisma
I applaud you
I cheer for you

Your such a winner
You've got what it takes

Should I clap a little louder
I applaud you
Should I cheer a little louder

Carolyn Arends,Happy,"Do I annoy you with my optimism?
Am I an insult to your realism?
I got hope and just a little bit of passion

And I know both those things have gone right out of fashion
So call me a rebel, you can call me a fool
I won't give up the fight, I just refuse

And I will dare to dream
I will dare to believe in something, baby
And I will dare to be happy
And I will dare to be happy

Does it offend you that I've made that decision?
Does it betray your sense of fatalism?
Please forgive me but I don't believe it's treason

For me to live my life like it's mine for a reason
So call me Pollyanna, you can call me a child
But I will not lie down, that's not my style

And I will dare to dream
I will dare to believe in something, baby
And I will dare to be happy
And I will dare to be happy

Do I annoy you with my stubborn insistence?
That love can save us and I've seen its existence
I got Jesus and a little bit of passion

And I know both those things have gone right out of fashion
So you can call me crazy 'cause here's what
I'm gonna do, I'm gonna dare to pray the same for you

And I will dare to dream
I will dare to believe in something, baby
And I will dare to be happy
And I will dare to be happy

I will dare to dream
I will dare to believe in something, baby
And I will dare to be happy
And I will dare to be happy
Yeah, I will dare to be happy",happy,1999
Devo,Going Under,"Left home with a friend of mine
Gone two years and I don't know why
Now I'm happy all the time
I can't think and I'm feeling fine
Girl put me in a situation
I'm going through soft core mutation

Think you've heard this all before
Now you're gonna hear some more
I know a place where dreams get crushed
Hopes are smashed, but that ain't much
Voluntary experimentation
Going through soft-core mutation

I'm going under
 
Down under where the lights are low
To a place where all the mutants go 
Doing things I never did before
Inside out and coming back for more
Little girl with the full red lips
Never knew it could be like this
You put me in a situation
Going through soft-core mutation

I'm going under",sad,1981

Walkin' to Jerusalem

And walkin' to Jerusalem

You kissed me and held me tight
You said you'd always be my cowgirl
But tonight you're hangin' out
With that Christian Dior crowd
So where does that leave me now girl
You're as cold as Polar regions
I oughta join the French Foreign Legion And Go

Walkin' to Jerusalem
Marchin' with Methuselah
Readin' signs in Arabic
Ravin' like a lunatic
By the time you tell me I'm the one

Studyin' the book of Job and

As fair as the moon, as bright as the sun?

The flash of it is a jealous fire no flood can quench
For love is as strong as death

Before the dawn breaks and the shadows flee
You ravished my heart with just one glance
My beautiful one, arise and come with me

Set me like a seal on your heart
For love is unyielding as the grave
The flash of it is a jealous fire no flood can quench
For love is as strong as death

Was far away when you caught my eye

I was alone out there, with no one else around

Till there was you, I know what you're needing
My thoughts are leading, me straight into your eyes
What can I do? I'm looking right at you
This feeling is all new, I want you addicted to me

Fate can act in a curious way
When all that mattered means nothing today
All that concerns me, that drenches my thoughts
Is the sensation that seeing you brought

I was alone out there, with no one else around
Now I've fallen for you, and there's no coming down

The Gathering,Gaya's Dream,"(Infatuated by the extensiveness of the universe, it's easy to forget one of the most complex enigmas of this world: The human mind, a universe of it's own.)

Open the gates of the past
With the key to our hearts
Dream of the years gone by
Centuries through mankind's eyes

In the wasteland that grows inside
Within me I shall find myself

Slowly walking, pacing front
See through these blind eyes
Stepping on shadows, touching air
Stones move as I stand still
Seek the answers in the skies
As we don't even know ourselves
Silent, as the sun sets before our eyes

In the wasteland that grows inside
Within me I shall find myself

For years of space technology
Still we haven't learned
Like children we explore
Things we can't yet comprehend

Open the doors of the past
With the beating of a heart
Dream as the years go by
Carrying our own cross
Seek the answers in the skies
As we don't even know ourselves
Silent, as the sun sets before our eyes",sad,2001
Jefferson Starship,Fading Lady Light,"I've had desert visions
When the moon is shining bright
The end of the rainbow promise
Almost in my sight
Sat with my back against cold stone
Waiting for the morning light
And all the things I've seen in dreams
Have kept me up all night
Always reaching to the sky
Soft hard stone
I'm sitting here and thinking
Bout all the centuries its known
Got a feeling someone's near
Listening to the East wind moan
You know there's no one here
But I just don't feel alone

Fading Lady Light
Always here with me
Singing your song in the wind at night
You know I've never felt so free
You're my reality
Don't you fade away from me
The wind it paints your face
As it stirs the shifting sand
Nightmare creatures closing in
They leave at your command
If only you were beside me now
Maybe I would understand
And I could leave my dreams for life
To live the dream we planned

Did you have to go to jail,
Put your house up on for sale, did you get a good lawyer?

I hope you'll find the right man who'll fix it for ya

Changed the colour of you hair, are you busy?
And did you have to pay the fine
You were dodging all the time, are you still dizzy?

Eazy-E,I'mma Break It Down,"[Eazy-E]
My eternal jam is the juice of the radio
takin' out profanity so they can play it though
listen to a hell of a kick and the high hat
going to the record store say ya gonna buy
that the E is connected to the A and the Z ya say Y
so that's how the beats stack it up on material made of hits 
takin' my time of each line to make sure it fits
push play on the instrumental thats recorded
step on stage and I'm suddenly awarded
some sort of track appeared like a plaque
and some hell of a scream from the girls in the back
takin' a bow cause I got style
never at the bottom of the ways on the top of the pile
yo it's Eazy on top even though I'm short 
guarenteed to help when I walk on the court
so get up make some noise for the gangsta clap
gonna tip the laugh I'm not a pranksta
I'm serious Dre my sounds so quit playin' around
cause I'mma break it down

[Eazy-E]
Last time I was takin' my time with this
but other suckaz were makin' a rhyme with this
I had to change the tip or make it hyper
but they was rotten, I was gettin' riper
ready to go, like never before
givin' you more because I'm ready to score
Ren is my buddy you can tell I said often
helpin' me destroy the suckaz that's softin'
curin' diseases, my rhyme pleases, throw it a key
balls havin' seasons, this is a doctrine
and I'm locked in, and I made up my mind
and I think I'm gonna rock then
you got beaches chill and I'mma push ya
to freeze after I'll cut ya cause I'mma butcher
and say ya have pricin' and then out ya go
cause a percentage on point bellys are very low
messin' with a gun but once ya get hurt
like a said before ya get rubbed in the dirt
I'm not a law man, but I'mma raw man
M.C. Ren: ""But ya the dopest one I ever saw!"" 
I keep droppin' it pound for pound
and when I'm on the mic I always throw down
to keep y'all dancin' to my funky sound
so listen cause I'mma break it down

[Eazy-E]
Now look at me and not the poster
and you could see right off I got the most of
the talent, experience or a trade 
and complements for the rhyme thats made
talks over today if this one so
pick another artist and dis one
I got the ballet of the chosen vote
cause I don't need water to clear my throat
comin' from the rain the show is like dancin'
nasty like and the girls are like glancin'
wantin' to get wit me this routine 
keepin' it sprung still stayin' mean
can ya dis this man I don't think so
once I start writin' the way I let the ink go
comin' out with songs like hit after hit
cause this is legit and yours ain't shit
makin' it sound so dope cause I'm a genius
but your amazed with ya happy to see this
brother go crazy on wax
flowin' away like if I was on a sax
doin' a solo in the shade I'm a spotlight
relax and chill while your up tight
pumpin' up the funky sounds
yo you should know it's kinda persist 
that the E is gonna break it down",sad,1988
Heaven 17,Come Live With Me (12'' Extended Version) (2006 Digital Remaster),"I was thirty-seven
You were seventeen
You were half my age
The youth I'd never seen
Unlikely people meeting in a dream
Heaven only knows the way it should have been 

Here today my tomorrow
Where you lead I will follow
All that kissing
No passion missing
Come live with me
Kiss the boys goodbye 
Come live with me
Kiss the boys goodbye 
Come live with me

Dinner parties followed
And all my age implies
My friends began to talk
I began to realise
If half the things they say
Are quarter true of me
Then how can I eclipse the youth
You gave to set me free 

There was something in your smile
That was hard to reconcile
The time had come to testify to reason
Though years will not erase
Remembrance of those days
At least there's no submission to hearts treason 

Here today my tomorrow
No more shame only sorrow
All that kissing
There's something missing
Come live with me
Kiss the boys goodbye 
Come live with me
Kiss the boys goodbye 
Come live with me

Now there's nothing left to cry for
And there's nowhere left to go
Just another hopeless fight
But how were we to know
The strong are sometimes wrong
But the weak are never free
The choice we made we can't evade
Don't try to follow me 

Here today my tomorrow
No more pain only sorrow
All that kissing
There's something missing
Come live with me
Kiss the boys goodbye
Come live with me
Kiss the boys goodbye
Come live with me
Kiss the boys goodbye
Come live with me
Kiss the boys goodbye
Come live with me
Kiss the boys goodbye

How much better off she would be
The longer I hold on and the longer this goes on
The harder that it's gonna be
But it's four in the morning and once more the dawning

I've never deserved her God knows when I hurt her
That's the last thing that I want to do
She tries but she can't tell how she feels but I know
Too well what she's going through
If I love her so much I don't know why I can't do
The right thing and just let her be
But it's four in the morning and once more the dawning
Just woke up the wanting in me

Last night I told her this time it's all over making
Ten times I've told her goodbye
Last night we broke up this morning I woke up
And for the tenth time I'm changing my mind
I saw more love in her eyes when I left her
Than most foolish men will ever see
And it's four in the morning and once more the dawning
Just woke up the wanting in me

Waiting to be had.

What you can give.

At this point in my life,
I'm grateful for what I get.

When everything I need is right here
At home?

I read that every good sermon
It starts with a story
To reel the audience in.
But I've got no life experience,
Just this terrible fear
That I'll captivate anything.
If I really have your attention
I'm desperate for the affection
Of a full capacity room.
As sweat seeps from my pores
I race for the door
And don't want it anymore.

So hey,
Why am I trying to escape,
When everything I need is right here?

You didn't make it that far.
They saw ya picking flowers 
From their yard.
Well hip, hip, hooray
What a wonderful escape.
And the way that I see
I see nothing at all,
I'm blindfolded in the backseat
Of a car.
Just drop me somewhere,
I can't retrace my steps.

Can I come back yet
To the only place
That clears my head?
To my home.

When you think you're hurting someone.

Is hurting someone -

And being on this road is anything but sure
Maybe we'll forget, I hope we don't forget

Wrap me up in a dream with you

Elvenking,Trows Kind,"(Music / Lyrics: Aydan)

Concealed from the view
Hidden from the knowledge of Men
A little kind through trees it lives
Nymphs of dark and lust
""Fairy of bad fate!""
Somebody tells he has seen
Some of the little ones
Some even that have talked with them
So nice and handsome
""Please, don't be such a fool!
Tell everyone that the witches come tonight""

(Bridge:)
Desire grows, denial howls
Your will has gone
""Divine the wicked multitude
Worship your servitude""
Enthroned and ringed with gold
Of the mighty old oak
I'm on the lightness side

(Chorus:)
Daughters and sons
There are times to carry on,
All my life for you
Keep on singing my tale
Deny the Trows kind
Don't you dare to stay behind?
Through years and centuries,
Through myth and poetry
Our race's slowly dying
In the heart of mankind

Deep in the woods
They're dressed with the fruits of earth
Arcane adorers of the roots
Dance Henking tonight
""Fairy of bad fate!""
Vanishing through branches
Followeed by the Redcaps
They´re greddy for silver and gold

(Bridge and chorus)

Trapped in a web of branches and leaves dead
You hear voices reciting a prayer...
Come nearer and see!

I am in a haire likeness, just see me there
But I shall be in a woman's likeness soon""",sad,2006

Well hang on please don't hang up let me talk to our machine

I know you said it's over but my hearts telling me that ain't right
I know it can't be over 'cause I still wake up reaching for you in the night
It took leaving for me to realize there's good in goodbye

I'm listening to the talking should I pick up the phone
And lay my pride aside and say come home
I've played that moment over time and time again
When giving up seemed easier than just giving in



I'll try to call you one more time
Baby if you'd just call me one more time",sad,2007

It's not my thing trying to get back
But this time let me tell you where I'm at
You don't have to worry 'cause I'm coming
Back to where I should have always stayed
And now I've heard the maybe to your story
And it's enough love for me to stay

Can it be I stayed away too long
Did I leave your mind when I was gone
It's not my thing trying to get back
But this time let me tell you where I'm at

I wanna, wanna be where you are
Anywhere you are
I wanna, wanna be where you are
Everywhere you are

Please don't close the door to our future
There's so many things we haven't tried
I could love you better than I used to
And give you all the love I have inside

I wanna, wanna be where you are
Any, any, anywhere you are
I wanna, wanna be where you are
I gotta be where you are",sad,1972
Mariah Carey,Someday,"Hey, hey, hey, hey

You were so blind to let me go
You had it all but did not know
No one you'll find will ever be
Closer to all your dreams than me

Believing the grass would be greener
You told yourself, 
But I know you'll soon discover
You're never satisfied with any other

Someday, ooh someday
One you gave away will be the only one you're wishing for
Someday, hey, hey
Boy you're gonna pay, 'cause baby I'm the one who's keeping score

You'll change your mind and call my name
Soon as you find they're all the same
And when you find yourself alone
Don't come back crying, you should have known

Believe me, I'm not pretending
It's not hard to predict this ending now
'Cause I know you'll soon discover
You're needing me in spite of all the others

Someday, ooh someday
One you gave away will be the only one you're wishing for
Someday, hey, hey
Boy you're gonna pay, 'cause baby I'm the one who's keeping score

 baby I'm the one who's keeping score

Maybe now you just can't conceive
That there'll ever come a time when you're cold and lonely
Baby, how could you ever believe
That another could replace me, the one and only

But when you're down in your time of need
And you're thinking that you
Might be coming back to own me
Just think again 'cause
I won't need your love anymore

Someday, ooh someday
One you gave away will be the only one you're wishing for
Someday, hey, hey
Boy you're gonna pay, 'cause baby I'm the one who's keeping score

Someday, ooh someday
One you gave away will be the only one you're wishing for
Someday, hey, hey
Boy you're gonna pay, 'cause baby I'm the one who's keeping score

Helmet,Give It,"Killing hurts
Has to be done
Peace and love
And who's number one
The right to give
Learn to bleed, it's free
Pain is outside
Lift it up to see

Step ahead
Always wear the past
Dying, soothe me
Beneath the smell of grass
No world secret
Kept is too intent
I've got my nerve
Self-help confidence

Confidence",sad,1992

Elvenking,A Fiery Stride (Ltd. Edition Bonus),"[Music: Jarpen, Aydan / Lyrics: Jarpen]

Follow again one single piece
of dream afar
Spent my all whole life there,
chasing the hope

A drive so strong,
so deep I cannot see the end
Inborn sense of finding
what's beyond, in the furious storm

Reunifying with air and soil I am part of
Distant yet so close!

Longing for a whisper
that would carry me away
Faced my ultimate desire that was swirling 
through the mazes of my mind

Watch my gold,
it can be never bought or sold
Made up and collected through the years
from emotions and dreams

A noble line I carry on 
Exploring the ways I never saw

Longing for a whisper
that would carry me away
Faced my ultimate desire that was swirling 
through the mazes of my mind

[Solo: Aydan]
[Melody: Jarpen / Regality: both]

Reunifying with air and soil I am part of
Distant yet so close!

Longing for a whisper
that would carry me away
Faced my ultimate desire that was swirling 
through the mazes of my mind
If you were given chance to fly would you
retain your tears of joy
Pushed as far as any wind will go,
a fiery stride to the sun

Clearing my path from anything
that leads me to a fall
On the brink of loneliness, I faced 
the illusion of leaving from the flock
On this one way trail to unfolding new
worlds",happy,2004
Fernando Ortega,Don't Let Me Come Home A Stranger (LP Version),"As I walked out one evening
To breathe the air and soothe my mind,
I thought of friends and the home I had,
And all those things I left behind.

A silent star shone on me,
My eyes saw a far horizon,
As if to pierce this veil of time,
And escape this earthly prison.

Will there come a time when the memories fade.
and pass on with the long, long years,
When the ties no longer bind?
Lord save me from this darkest fear.
Don't let me come home a stranger,
I couldn't stand to be a stranger.",sad,1997
Amorphis,Into Hiding,"The islander slips into hiding
And takes to his heels
Out of dark Northland
The murky house of Sara
He whirled out of doors as snow
Arrives as smoke in the yard
To flee from bad deeds

There he had to become someone else
He must change his shape
As an eagle he swept up
Wanted to soar heavenward
The sun burnt his cheeks
The moon lit his brows",sad,1994
Tammy Wynette,I Stayed Long Enough,"Accident'ly in your arms and that's all it took
Knowing how you want and need me with just one look
To leave you now is something you should know that I can't do
I stayed long enough to fall in love with you
Long enough to know that what I feel won't go away
Just lookin' won't be near enough after today
Everything I need is everything I see in you
I stayed long enough to fall in love with you

Yes everything I need...
I stayed just long enough to fall in love with you",happy,1968

I got the numbers on my side

I... didn't want to love you
I... swear to God it's true
I... don't like dreaming of you
But i... but damn my soul, I do.

Y'see, I got hit so hard, I thought I was dyin'
Then I fell so far, I thought I could fly


Darling from the start, if somebody's lying,
Double-cross your heart, and don't even try.

Because i... sure don't want to need you
I...'d hate to count on you
I...'m tired of going crazy, anymore
But i... but damn my soul, I do.

Don't give me no more goddamn pain

Looking down like an angel, upon my lonely life
And no matter the angle, I want you to be my wife

I was dreaming, you understood
You were thinking, you wished you would
Looking down form your high horse
Like I didn't matter, of course

What they say at the funeral, it darkens and remorse
You were thinking I was sleeping in my thoughts
So lonely my tears fall down my brain
Rode my train for a cheap price, baby it's no surprise

Looking down from your high horse
Listening to my lullaby
I was thinking, that the world of sin
A sinking feeling, like I'm falling in love again

Looking down from your high horses

Well they tore another building down

This town is through

So we’re going out west where the winds won’t harm us now
And the car is in the lane
We’ll never be the same

The stores are setting up for Halloween
Back at school the kids are cool
Painted ponies in this one horse town
Are getting old
I’ve been bought and sold

There’s a feeling I get when I talk to you mama

So I hang around till the fall and I’ll be there

Naughty By Nature,Family Tree,"Sometimes because of jealousy and the intent to demise
Certain factions have to be forbidden or destroyed
Fire has to be sent to the poisoned forest
With the root of fresh trees planted elsewhere

Only then will you obtain a wilderness
That cannot be penetrated, petrified family tree

See what started as a family forest
Got cut to a family tree with the limbs
And the leaves looking' at the world for answers
The world points to the sun and the sun says

The answers in me, so I search through the darkness
Can't find the key so we locked in the land of the lost
Lord, please tomorrow ain't promised to you nor me
So now we choose the roots, so we can plant new trees

Many minds always meet with pens and sheets
Close my eyes, think what next on my rhymes
See this face in ink, I'm havin' visions of wisdom
Dreamin' 'bout my own ending

Am I seein' death as freedom and livin' as prison
My son didn't have a daddy to shape him so
God bless him with a daddy to save him
Yeah I raise him and pay some attention

He talked and he listened to reach him and teach him
Before I'm gone from existence
Teach him 'bout the foes, the hos and all opponents
Those that always talk 'bout love but never showed it

Those who had the chances to stand and always blowed it
Those that set you up by the hour to steal your moment
Pac the word is you ain't there so fuck the rumor
I'll get a pound of that shit from Bermuda

And meet you in Cuba
Fucked up on Larusa no doubt, I know the locale
If they gotta born you, I'm gonna mourne you 'til I join you

See what started as a family forest
Got cut to a family tree with the limbs
And the leaves looking' at the world for answers
The world points to the sun and the sun says

The answers in me, so I search through the darkness
Can't find the key so we locked in the land of the lost
Lord, please tomorrow ain't promised to you nor me
So now we choose the roots, so we can plant new trees

Uhh and now I know I got some family
Who missed me from the heart, forever we're apart
Just because I'm nothin' and you abuse me and use me
Now you wanna try to come bruise me

And even though maybe were in there
Farther than it once was I know family don't always
Mean that they blood 'cause some people just
Don't give a nigga what some people tried to use my name

So all the fat we had to cut and I'm still
Walking with my six amp strut
Urban eyes see through camouflage
And now I know who's butt

So when I sent you tried to play me
All of a sudden now I'm shady
Maybe deep down in my heart
Never trust you from the start

Never hoped you'd be my homie, don't come 'round my way
And if we never speak again, it's got to be that way
This millennium, we'll be spankin' your heiny
Remind thee naughty invented family of the 90's

See what started as a family forest
Got cut to a family tree with the limbs
And the leaves looking' at the world for answers
The world points to the sun and the sun says

The answers in me, so I search through the darkness
Can't find the key so we locked in the land of the lost
Lord, please tomorrow ain't promised to you nor me
So now we choose the roots, so we can plant new trees

Life doesn't end when the sweat dries
A time when a nickle cost a dollar
When you rise your chest dies
My dynasty many fear it cos' I'm near it

Ancient Egyptian scriptures fitted in through hyroglyphics
Motherfuckers try to touch my mental state
Niggas smile up in your face and then they infiltrate
So it seems nowadays that the only plan

To get my people help my people get a load of land
And Im'ma see it if I have to kill some shit
To make my family tree a motherfucking wilderness
See a black man standin' on the promised land

Since they broke every promise I devised a plan this
Black this and black that crap is gettin' touchy
Any black hat that cross my path, I call him lucky
Those who turn. they back with they fears

And try to before they can see us
They gonna need us sweet Jesus

See what started as a family forest
Got cut to a family tree with the limbs
And the leaves looking' at the world for answers
The world points to the sun and the sun says

The answers in me, so I search through the darkness
Can't find the key so we locked in the land of the lost
Lord, please tomorrow ain't promised to you nor me

Novembre,Reason,"(C. Orlando, Pagliuso, G. Orlando)

Upon the rivers of the day
It blows a cool breeze in the air
Of thoughts and shimmering hours of May
And all its feelings

I dared to walk down by the lane
Calm and fearless in the rain
I felt that you were by my side
Calm and tender

You are the reason for this May
Has washed the purple clouds away

You are the reason for this May
Has washed the purple clouds away

You are the reason for this May
Is warm and fills me with its rays

Listen, all the time we witness miracles,
All the time!

We thought that anyone that has a life
Bear the cross of the passion and of the time
Oh, the way I was blind!

The time I stumbled over your blue eyes
I felt like falling into a pool of joy
And a sort of miracle happened
The ancient fortress vanished at your smile

You are the reason for this May
Has blown all darkness far away
You are the reason for this May
Is warm and fills me with its rays",happy,2006

Hustlers stand around me,

Big city gamblers, gamblers take my money
Yes it gets to be useless, yes it's useless to me
And I think I'm lost, when I'm lost inside this jungle
Can't see the forest for the tress
Well pretty little woman come and get me
Try me, try me one more time

Cant' fix this broken heart of mine

Shai Hulud,We Who Finish Last,"We cast no shadow
The stars do not shine here
Be content to light your own path
And burn what you have crossed
The bridges were frail
The people, pretended

Storm forth with the light of the inflamed
Reclaim and ignite the sky
Brightly to blind
Rip off the veneers enabling opportunists to thrive
Dam the rise of grime and rats

More sickening than a social circle that believes itself charmed
Are the writhing droves of blowhards and yes men
Clamoring to slither in
Stay sovereign on the outside

We are who finished last
The unaffected
Contrasting the wide and white
We are who finish last
Sound
Indignant
The iron to gleaming teeth
The salt on saccharin
We who finish last
Proudly in their darkness
Lit from within

Glad hands grabbing for brass rings
Painting their bricks gold
Keen sycophants filthy scheming
Furthering the feuds of their adored
They have picked their enemies impeccably
Very keen indeed

And so siege the scorned

We are naught but beds of thorns and dark horses
Unwelcome guests who will just not mind their place
A single musket ball to pierce and lodge inside
And lead the circle to crack

We cast no shadow
The stars do not shine here
No genuine light to be found
Only rays of cold, synthetic beams on a mock aristocracy
so the vain and insecure can feel revered and cared for
For a cheap, fleeting moment
Truly noble

Storm forth with the light
We who finish last
Proudly in our darkness
Lit from within

Conflict in the chest
To be concerned for the needs of such heartless men",sad,2008

A season that last through all changes in time
I try so hard sometimes
I wish there was a raincheck on tommorow
Not ready to deal with what I don't wanna find

Struggling on, just to hold on
I just wanna know, why is it me?

In a tear there is a message from the heart
Detached from the good, it's hope gone astray
I cry so hard sometimes
Too scared to think what will bring tommorow
Already much more than I can handle today

I can't breathe, suffocate as I'm buried by hate
And so sadly I learn, there's no justice to fate
I just wanna know why is it me?
Losing the race with thoughts out of place
I just wanna, know why is it me?

You know plenty has made it my way
You aint got a monopoly on sorrow

There's a pain so insane that I fight but can't tame
And my mind battles on as my body lies lame

I can't feel the feel but it feels like it hurts
I can't feel the feel but it feels like it hurts
I can't feel the feel but it feels like it hurts

It'll drive you farther down...

Paying for a crime you weren't charged for 
Alive in a world that always wants more
Is it any wonder that you're falling back
Inside the pattern that defines all you lack?
Don't you want to get into your car and get out of this town?
Get out of this town?

Every time it rains

Just not making it on my own

Sometimes late at night 
I close my eyes 
And pretend that you're here with me 
Every time it rains 
I realize just how lonely my life is gonna be 

Every time it rains 
Every time I hear the raindrops fall 
I may say I don't mind it at all

From me
Somehow you set the wheels in motion

You gave that boy a gun

You took our innocence

Missy Higgins,The Special Two (Australian Version),"I've hardly been outside my room in days,
'Cos I don't feel that I deserve the sunshine's rays.
The darkness helped until the whiskey wore away,
And it was then I realized that conscience never fades.
When you're young you have this image of your life:
That you'll be scrupulous and one day even make a wife.
And you make boundaries you'd never dream to cross,
And if you happen to you wake completely lost.
But I will fight for you, be sure that
I will fight until we're the special two once again.

And we will only need each other, we'll bleed together,
Our hands will not be taught to hold another's,
'Cos we're the special two.
And we could only see each other, we'll breathe together,
These arms will not be taught to need another's,
'Cos we're the special two.

I remember someone old once said to me:
That lies will lock you up with truth the only key
But I was comfortable and warm inside my shell,
And couldn't see this place could soon become my hell.
So is it better to tell and hurt or lie to save their face?
Well I guess the answer is don't do it in the first place.
I know I'm not deserving of your trust from you right now,
But if by chance you change your mind you know I will not
Let you down 'cos we were the special two, and will be again.

And we will only need each other, we'll bleed together,
Our hands would not be taught to hold another's,
'Cos we're the special two.
And we could only see each other we'll breathe together,
These arms will not be taught to need another's
'Cos we're the special two.

I step outside my mind's eyes for a minute.
And I look over me like a doctor looking for disease,
Or something that could ease the pain.
But nothing cures the hurt you bring on by yourself,
Just remembering, just remembering how we were

And we would only need each other, we'd bleed together,
These hands would not be taught to hold another's,
We were the special two.
And we could only see each other we'd bleed together,
These arms would not be taught to need another's
'Cos we're the special two.",sad,2007
Dropkick Murphys,The Only Road (Album Version),"How could you choose a path without knowing 
where you'd end up
Where you came from was a time and
place that you had never been

(Is this the only road)

Can you fake your way through conversation 
or just simply turn away
Set a course for the desert sun 

Is this the only choice
To live without a choice,
this is the only choice we'll know

Cut your teeth and now it's time to show the world that what your made of
Was a travesty that many just call luck

(Is this the only road)

Now climb aboard the red line train that's headed out of town
Or stick around and just relive your past

Is this the only choice
To live without a choice,
this is the only choice we'll know

You're always running out of wind and you keep saying it's the end
You're always hoping that you'll win,
but then you throw in the towel in",sad,2011
Carpenters,An Old Fashioned Christmas,"How I miss that old-fashioned Christmas
Carols being sung by the tree
Window's candlelight shining bright
For the whole world to see

Children's eyes of sweet expectations
Wondering what each present will hold
Lying in their beds and impatient
On long Christmas Eves of old

It used to be that all the family
Would gather for this one night
It used to be that special feeling
Shared together knowing
Christmas was here
One night a year

How I miss that old-fashioned Christmas
Memories that last through the years
Call me sentimental, don't mind if you do
I wish an old fashioned Christmas to you",sad,1992
Sick Of It All,Consume (LP Version),"No use ignoring me, I represent the darkest thing you feel. 
No use avoiding me, I'm woven in the fabric of your being. 
Don't back away from me, I feed on apprehension and fear. 
Don't back away from me, don't blind yourself to what you really should be seeing. 

A part of you that will consume if given the chance to, 
A part of you that will abuse whenever allowed to. 
A part of you that will consume if given the chance to, 
A part of you that wants to see you loose it all. 

C'mon, see what you get. 
C'mon, when will you 
Come to terms with what's inside,
Come to terms with what you try to hide.

Emotion overload, might really mean the end of the road. 
Emotion overload, might mean the end of everything you know.
Emotional check, just might reveal emotional wreck. 
Emotional check, just might reveal your weakness 'cause you've finished.",sad,1994

Watching the people as they pass

She stumbled, started to slip and fall,
Teeter-tottered on the top of patent leather shoes.
I happened to catch her and said,
""Maybe these ruby shoes are a little cumbersome for you.""
Maybe for you, now.

But not as shaky as I must have seemed,
Talking junk through her giggle little teenage dream.
And on the phone I could not compete,
My dumb luck fake confidence was getting weak.

But sure enough in a gruff, faint voice,

And I bet we could build a home, but I know the right thing for me to do...
Is to leave you alone.

I got the biggest boulders right here motherfucker
These motherfucking rocks fat,
Hey, at ten 'o clock I don't wanna see
None of y'all little niggas up on the motherfucking block
Y'all got ta clear this motherfucka off
Curfew nigga, get ta fuck up outta here off my block

Verse 1: Bizzy Bone

Who servin' tha fiends
Hundred thousands of green
For the love of money
Cash all around me
Demons can cloud me
While I'm in the county I can die
Flipped up my style-y as we came at the same time
Baby tempted, in the tension
Ouija shit got you demented
Crash the Benz and ending your sentence
Born for criminal defendants
Critical breaking in the ghetto bar thinking
Millenium shit like pestilence war and famine
Animals move animals reputed
Every daily grades let it be the reason
My Cleveland niggas revolve like dead bodies
In Eden leading seeping
And I don't wanna rock the pump
But I doubt it if I have ta pop the trunk
I'ma get 'em when they thinking they miss me what
Nigga that thuggish ruggish fuck them up
Rolling wid my bucks in the biggest snatch shit
All of my dogs all of we lie
Nigga you touched and stuck on murda
Smoking up bud and fucking up blunts
It was the 7th sign regime
Wid the nines and beams the philly and green
Wid a clik tight team and a nigga like me
Ya couldn't go wrong wid we
Eyes bloodshot red when I floss instead
I rather run up and smash you wid a passion
And they chalking it off his head
Nigga instead I'ma let them bleed
Nigga, immortal warrior from the walking dead

Hook:
It's just another day I gotta get paid
Who got the biggest boulder
Who servin' tha fiends

Verse 2: Layzie Bone

Now could this be B-O-B
The bad boy the Bone

Pull a nigga wig back
Nigga dig that dig that
All original peep the zone criminal here we go
>From a place where a nigga might bury ya
Nigga act up and I betta take care ah ya
Scared ah ya, I be ready for the war
Nigga I'm America's Most
Barely coast ta coast
If you ready for whateva you can ride wit me
But if you lie ta me and don't die for me
Look in my eyes and see you can't hide from me
Sleepwalk shit talk nigga
That be running from niggas in the ghetto
Now get on my level rebuking the Devil
Representing like ah heavenly rebel
Even though my screws loose I can tigheten 'em up
And put a twist to the game like a monkey wrench
For the funny shit
All about the murda for the love ah money shit
Gettin' paid, got it made in the shade nigga
If you got and I want it I'ma take it
Nigga made it and I told ya we'd make it
Kept it real and it'd neva be fake shit
Half baked and gone off this indoe stick
Wanna hit it call just as you next
Hit it two times and pass
And nigga hold ya breath
Lay playing wid a half deck
Playin' wid ah half deck

For she end up like superhead, giving superhead,
Every nigga in the industry now fuck superhead,
And I might just fuck her too,
If I ever catch her sliding or riding through the (Streets of Compton),
Rolling down Green Leaf smoking on that green leaf,
With a Mac 10 like I was born on Queen's Street,
Murder MCs like I was born in Queen's Bridge,
That how I show you palm niggas where the King is,
And you don't wanna play chess on a time clock,
I'm in the Hall Of Fame next to Snoop, behind 'Pac,

And you're unaware
And your friends all say that you're looking great
Those black and white movies apply

Deep down schemin' how to kill 'em
Misleadin' a bit, although proceedin' a hit
I made 'em feel I'd never jeopardise my freedom for shit
Played the empty headed part, 
Though the moment they dreaded start, neat
Back of the head and took the credit card
Seen properly decease,
Made it look like an everyday robbery to police
And I's out
Police believed a thief pop for sureity, a jerky
Alert the rest to beef up security
And not to get flashy, although another blast occurred
Another brother deservin' to get massacred
Pleasure in poppin' that flea
Should a heard mister tough guy coppin' mad pleas
Not insane, nor am I biased
Though feels good to watch a motherfucker die before 
my fly ass
Ain't nuttin' to blast, fuck it
Then I put some crack vials in the ass pocket and was off
Police said a thug awaited, since I didn't leave no evidence
A drug related incident

I still clock the mil' figures, cock back triggers
Reason why your girlfriends dig us - cause I kill niggaz

You are my shining star, my guiding light, my thug fantasy

While your army a nigger snickering among self - thiefs
Who wanna clock the bread off the next
That's why Im gonna blow their fucking head off
Maybe the victor get stuck up
Giving these clowns opportunity to fuck up
They knowin' that the kid crew showers, eye cowers
And leaves for 'bout a good two hours
While they're like 'we coulda caught Rick what, for allsort'
That's what the assholes thought
Tough guy mumblin', I thunderin'
Why I had a motherfucking A-K ya wondering
And raise it higher, start giving them the fire
As they scream like high pitch women like Mariah
Blood on the wall like, other brothers ball like they hit
Seein' shots split a motherfuckers skull like lettuce
Run a nigger best bet is for another duck in gage
I'm in a motherfucking rage
Mask 'bout face, Now figure dash
Smash 'bout 10 ta 15 nigger ass out
More enemy dug, deceased, caught
Had not, gave one fuck what police thought (what?)
But first I best provide all brainiacs
With evidence of a suicidal maniac

The Fray,Absolute,"I've seen this one before, the girl she gets away 
Everybody knows it but no one tries to stop it 
Cause she barely even knows him but if she could see inside 
Everything is quiet as she waits to tell him who she is 

Is this all we get to be absolute 

Quiet but I'm sure there is something here 
Tell me everything cause I want to hear 

It's a kiss sits upon on her lips that waits for planes and battle ships 
She wants to be a dancer and he has got a picture 
On his wall and it's a sailor in a new port every night 
Yet man was born to trouble like sparks fly upwards innocent 

Is this all we get to be absolute 

Quiet but I'm sure there is something here 
Tell me everything cause I want to hear

Quiet but I'm sure there is something here 
Tell me everything cause I want to hear

All we are and all we want 
40 years come and gone 
All we are in photographs 
Will never be taken

Tell me everything cause I want you here

Remember how it used to be,
Remember when you were still in love with me

But you turned away,

I'm lost without your love
and I won't survive
Don't leave me alone tonight
I'm lost without your love and I won't survive

I can't believe that we are through
Is it someone else?
Have ya found somebody new?
Cuz I die inside everytime I close my eyes
and imagine myself living without you

I drew a line on this patch of ground
Everything's safe and everything's sound
In these four walls

I can remember
Borders I had to break
Now I can see I had this life
To make

I'm gonna miss your southern drawl
A baby's footsteps in an empty hall
And every little thing I can ever recall
In these four walls

Up on the rooftop
Feel like you're flying
Thinking your heart could break
Oh can't you see we had this love

You know I called you up cos nothing takes your place
I've got a heart of stone and it's sinking deep inside

How can I ever re-pay you
Help me Lord to see just what you say

Gym Class Heroes,To Bob Ross With Love (Album Version),"now who you know leave the scene
messier than canvas's by Jackson Pollock
throwing multicolored thoughts at a rapid pace
I make a mess you dissect it and make sense of it
then get back to me at your earliest convenience
check my verbal sequence as I texturize these tracks
seven layers to be exact eliminate the whack
with a firm brush stroke I mc paintily
lyricists begin crumbling from my stumbling technique
as I tweak your audio and visual keep my drips minimal messages subliminal
cause me and rap go way back we compliment
so together we enhance one another that's common sense
high intensity catches the eye your jaw drops
be a real critic not explicit with false props
I keep my darks deep my lights bright I'm very thorough
with my chiaroscuro inspiration spark and a knife
Now watch me rock the spot like ? minus the heroin
and make my face popular like Andy did to Marilyn
its kinda scary when real art gets left behind
while they take bullshit and start sellin' it to blind folks
but I remain humble as long as ? continues spinnin' hot shit
on his twin twelve-hundred color wheels of steel
fuck mass appeal art is art only the real can truly feel it
so open your eyes and listen
combine your ears with vision
or do it cause you love it
or for cash that's your decision
that's your decision
that's your decision

its like I'm torn between two worlds
a paintbrush and a microphone
a canvas or a beat
CD or LP
anything goes when my ink pen flows
and God only knows where its gonna bring me next
so I'm inclined to like paint rhymes and spit kaleidoscopes with one eye closed
and I suppose if you chose the path that I chose
you know the cycle ass ho don't front
it goes inspiration and productivity then a sense of self worth and in steps depression
like back and forth and forth and back
should I paint a picture or record a track
a gift or a curse I don't know I'm still undecided
but over the years I've found clever ways to hide it
and those that lack the passion I have may despise it
but my momma made me this way I thank her everyday
so tell them kids to keep coloring outside the lines
until they lose they limitations and they minds is free
tell them teachers that you want your money back this time
and tell Bob Ross thanks for all the happy little trees
and tell my momma that her baby boy is doing just fine
although hes running out of patience but his mind is free
and tell my pops that I'll pay his money back sometime
and that his son is two steps away from where he needs to be",happy,2005

And it kicks so strong, the kick goes on

It's an endless song
One, two, three, it goes on

Your hero is a zero
And you're just another weirdo
It comes on like a bomber, a long distance drummer

Where was I during the beating
Separation of body mind and...

I can still see his face
The lines upon his face
And if could erase the hate

Anyway, that you want to
Anytime, that I can show you

Jesse Malin,Broken Radio,"I was thinking about another time still in my mind
When I used to know a little girl high on this world
Your baby loves you more than you know
Raised on rivalry and rock'n roll
Moving to the motor City soul 
She lets go
On the radio
Well we never had a lot of cash
But we loved those kids
Some say that she missed the boat
But she just burned the bridge
The angels love you more than you know
Raised on robbery and rock'n roll
Moving to the Motor City soul
She takes hold
On the radio
Stomachache Sundays
And books we never read
Well I was hoping one day
We might meet again
She used to talk about astrology
She was born in June
She danced with strangers and celebrities
Empty stars and the full moon
I was thinking about the universe
For what its worth
Or the one about the Phoenix bird
That died and then returned
The angels love you more than you know
Raised on robbery and rock' n roll
Moving to the Motor City soul
Moving to the Motor City soul
Sometimes I see her face
When there's no place to go
On the radio
On the radio
On the radio

Set Your Goals,summer jam,"December 26th, 04. Dan's dad's dropping of the van for the Make Move tour. We're meeting up soon with The Warriors. We're losing money and our lunches on the jeans Matt wore to the first show. We're on the road.

May 22nd, 06. Zoli just tried to Ignite a roman candle stick. We're troubling the stateside with CIS. A full-blown assault on the whole US. Take on the world and see it all.

Even as we get older we can do it all over. Make our own plans and score the music to our own lives. Looking into the future, there is more room to move here, invincible as we score the music to our own lives.

And dreams lived all throughout 07. EU kinships with No Trigger begin. Anticipating the fall with New Found. Awe-struck by GB in Berlin.

And sometimes Snacksidents will happen, and it's so hard to keep your Razzberry Cool. Hey, I'm in Georgia with Fireworks and Justin K. We're all in a holding cell but somehow Baloni got away. I'm just trying to get my smoothie on, dawg.

Even as we get older we can do it all over. Make our own plans and score the music to our own lives. Looking into the future, there is more room to move here, invincible as we score the music to our own lives.

Now we gotta react, we gotta think fast. Side-bust hits leave us delirious. Outspoken hearts, restless as sharks. My life, my pride. Save me the daylight. Bring me home. It's OK because my way has only got to work for me. I'm trying my hardest to make the most of every minute. Time flies. And the top of the world is calling. Time grabs me by the shoulders. We're holding on.

Marty Robbins,A Castle In The Sky,"I dreamed that we were livin' in a castle in the sky
A world of make believe, a dream for you and I
For one time in my lifetime, I was sure about your love
I held you in my castle in the sky.

Then from another world a stranger came one day
I begged you not to leave, but you left any-way
I saw my castle tumble back to earth and there was I
With mem'ries of my castle in the sky.

The trouble that we're havin', does it mean there's someone new
Or am I just bothered by the thought of losing you
Will someone come and take you, will I lose you by and by
Like I lost you in my castle in the sky.

If we should ever part, the world for me would end
How could I tell my heart, I only lost a friend
Be faithful, don't forsake me, never leave and say goodbye
Like you left me in my castle in the sky.",happy,2008

It was just I couldn't seem to choose
What I should

So what did I decide? How could I respond?
When I could feel that You still loved me all along
I was so confused and You were so unmoved

When You were the one who came down and stayed close
You were the hand that would not let me go
I make it all about me when it's the wrong thing to do
You were the one, it was You

I messed it up, I wasted so much time
I couldn't see the thing You had in mind
So I stayed the course that I was on
But You were good, You cared enough to stop
You opened up the doors that had been locked
And saved me

I wanted to leave, well, enough alone
I didn't wanna risk, I couldn't seem to grow
I was such a fool and You were staying true

When You were the one who came down and stayed close
You were the hand that would not let me go
I make it all about me when it's the wrong thing to do
You were the one, it was You

So what did I decide? How could I respond?
When I could feel that you still loved me all along

Verse One: Wyclef Jean

Yo, I wrote this in Haiti, overlooking Cuba
I asked her what's her name, she said, 'Guantanamera'
Remind me of an old latin song, my uncle used to play
On his old forty-five when he used to be alive
She went from a young girl, to a grown woman
Like a Virgin, so she sex with no average mahn
Peep the figure, move like a caterpillar
Fly like a butterfly, let your soul feel her glide
Pac Woman better yet Space Invader
If your name was Chun-Li, we'd be playin Street Fighter
Penny for your thoughts, a nickel for your kiss
A dime if you tell me that you love me

Verse Two: Lauryn Hill

Yo, she was a rose in Spanish Harlem, mamacita beg your pardon
Make stakes at a faster rate then she fornicates
Pure traits of genius, Goddess of Black Venus
Crab niggaz angry cause they can't get between us
to no sele-xion, smooth complex-ion
The lexicon of Lexington, parents came from Cuba
Part Mexican, pure sweet, dimes fell to her feet
She like Movado, and shook her hips like Delgado
And broke niggaz down from the Grounds to Apollo
and then some, she took her act sent it to dim sum
And waited patiently while the businessmen come
Call late on purpose, got even politicians nervous
And made plans to infiltrate the street secret service
This gentle flower, fertility was her power
Sweet persona, Venus Flytrap primadonna
Que sera que sera she turned dinero to dinera

But I'll get up and fight back, anyway
You and I are not huge mainstream stars
But unlike them, we're really what we are

We got main street eyes
Watchin' as the big boys roll by
Under rotten television skies
We got main street eyes

I saw a kitten squashed in the street
I read about a plastic surgeon and his art 
Collection.

We are played for suckers all the time
Phony rock and roll
It's a crime
I don't want to dip myself in trash
I don't want to give myself for cash

We got main street eyes
Tryin' to do what' decent with our lives
Under funny television skies
We got main street eyes

Walkin' around sometimes
I see a tension under the surface
People are just about ready to explode.

So hold me, and trust me

Owl City,On The Wing,"Breathe, and I'll carry you away into the velvet sky
And we'll stir the stars around
And watch them fall away into the Hudson Bay
And plummet out of sight and sound

The open summer breeze will sweep you through the hills
Where I live in the Alpine Heights
Below the Northern Lights, I spend my coldest nights
Alone, awake, and thinking of
The weekend we were in love



Home among these mountaintops can be so awfully dull
A thousand miles from the tide
But photos on the walls of New York shopping malls
Distract me so I stay inside

I wish the rockets stayed over the Promenade
'Cause I would make a hook and eye
And fish them from the sky, my darling, she and I
We're hanging on so take us high
To sing the world goodbye

I am floating away
Lost in a silent ballet
I'm dreaming you're out in the blue
And I am right beside you
Awake to take in the view

Late nights and early parades
Still photos and noisy arcades
My darling we're both on the wing
Look down and keep on singing
And we can go anywhere

Are you there?

Are you there?

Or are you just a decoy dream in my head?
Am I home or am I simply tumbling all alone?

I am floating away 
Lost in a silent ballet 
I'm dreaming you're out in the blue
And I am right beside you
Awake to take in the view

Late nights and early parades 
Still photos and noisy arcades 
My darling we're both on the wing
Look down and keep on singing
And we can go anywhere


Are you there?",happy,2008
Keb' Mo',The Door,"I was down for so long
Everything I did was wrong
And I found fault
In everyone but me

I was hurt and alone
I could not find my way home
Broke-down and hungry
And too tired to moan

Then I heard somebody calling my name
Saying ain't no need to be shamed
I found out that the door was always open

I was trapped in my mind
A prisoner of my own design
Lost in a world
A world of confusion

I was there by myself
Couldn't find no help no where else
Thought I'd call up the hotline
But there was nobody there

Then I heard somebody calling my name
Saying ain't no need to be shamed
I found out that the door was always open

Saying ain't no need to be shamed

Brooke White,Hold Up My Heart,"Please, hold up my heart
Give me a reason for this empty silence

You're here but you seem so far
Why did you run away from me?
Is it because I'm not as pretty as I used to be?
Oh, like a picture on the wall,
Shoulda known that I was bound to fall,

So please, hold up my heart
Give me a reason for this empty silence
Please, hold up my heart
Darlin', I am changing, but everybody's changing too.

When I am weak, try to always find the best of you and me
But I will always be the one who understands you
Like a picture on the wall
Shoulda known that I was bound to fall

So please, hold up my heart
Give me a reason for this empty silence
Please, hold up my heart
Darlin' I am changing, but everybody's changing too.

We share hope, we share life
We share kisses by the fire
and I will always be the one who understands you

So please, hold up my heart
Give me a reason for this empty silence

The Ocean,Eoarchaean,"Where does it come from
And how was it made?
Who died in the process
And who got paid a starvation wage? Shopcops protect
A terrifying place
Willing to serve you 24 hours a day
Slick etiquettes
A great masquerade
Fluorescent tubes illuminate milelong aisles
Aseptic floors
Colorful shelves: myriads of products, but all their content is the same
Fooled and deceived
Who made us fall for this sham?
Who made us swallow the bait that we need all that shit?
Place your blind faith
In every produce
Don't hesitate or enquire, just follow our rules
No one complains
Customer is king
Why would you bother, just enter the pin
Who made us fall
Fall for the myth
That we would be better off with everything at our fingertips?
No one realized
How somewhere along the line
We have surrendered to the great void in our lives
Overwhelmed by the immense selection
Exerted to cover our inanition
Afraid that there's something that we could be missing
We'd pay any price to buy everything
We stand in line and smile....Celebrate the great emptiness of our lives
Celebrate the great emptiness of our lives
Celebrate the great emptiness of our lives
Celebrate the great emptiness of our lives",sad,2007
Tones On Tail,Burning Skies,"And the air was alive
With piercing sound and burning skies
The horror did me good,
The magic was on my side

And hot and cold ideas
Were running onto your eyes
Your sinking grey eyes
She shook his head like so much meat
The horror did me good
Time to exercise 

Like ice about to melt
You empty yourself of everything
It's cold and grey again
Your body begins to fall

The colour blinds your eyes
The flavour dulls your taste of anything
You try to break out
But some thing's just locked the door 

You'll get blue eyes
If you stand too close to him
And if I jump for help
You die inside your dream
I love you like you love me not
I love you like you love me not

City High,What Would You Do?,"Boys and girls, wanna hear a true story?
Saturday night was at this real wild party
They had the liquor overflowing the cup
About five, six strippers trying to work for a buck

And I took one girl outside with me
Her name was Lila, she went to junior high with me
I said: ""Why you up in there dancing for cash?
I guess a whole lot has changed since I've seen you last"", she said

(What would you do if your son was at home
Crying all alone on the bedroom floor?
'Cause he's hungry and the only way to feed him is to
Sleep with a man for a little bit of money)

In and out of lock down, I ain't got a job now
So for you this is just a good time
But for me this is what I call life, mmm)

Girl, you ain't the only one with a baby
But that's no excuse to be living all crazy
Then she looked me right square in the eye
And said: ""Everyday I wake up hoping to die""

She said: ""Nigga, I know about pain 'cause
Me and my sister ran away so my daddy couldn't rape us
Before I was a teenager
I'd done been through more shit you can't even relate to""

Get up on my feet and let go of every excuse

Workin' for wages
Till the company moved out

I've got four mouths to feed
I go out every day looking for suitable employment

Got a little bit too old
So I became a secretary
Married a man
In Las Vegas, Nevada
And ten years later
He ran out on the kids and me
Some said I was pretty
But those days are over
Now I've no place to live
And I'm out on the streets

My mom's a babysitter
And I don't like the Russians

Will they hurt everyone in my family

Sticky fingers of a different kind
The same word, foreign language
In the same season, they killed you twice
For the sake of human nature
Sweet smell shotgun for the hip and blind

She strokes the gun - feel how it's warm

It'll cut right through last month's flavour
with a mouthful, wasted terrors
Kill your Darlings, Kill your Darlings

Sayin' things I don't understand
Can't come up with no new lines
from their sweet surfaced mouths

She strokes the gun - feel how it's warm
Got a mouthful dirt and razors
It'll cut right through last month's flavour

Kill your Darlings, Kill your Darlings

Kiss the gun, bite the bullets
Get off the stick - get on
She can
Well I've seen all their faces
Shakin' hands full of napalm traces

Saddened I'm no coward please bury me they broke my wings in an attempt to 
Divide a sickness from comfort of open wounds wide eyed I died",sad,2000

When will these ideas really be my own?
Cause this moment keeps on moving
We were never meant to hold on

This was a scene worth waking up for
When I woke up
You planted me in my own body
Don't know why
But somehow it just feels so wrong

When you said I will be lonely
But when you rise again I'll have become the sun
And I will shine down upon you
As if you were the only one

Your voice is your own, I can't protect it
You'll have to sing
A verse no one has ever known

Just trying to protect yourself
And other fools like you
So well practised
In your deceit
Behind the high walls of stupidity
Your endless conceit
Behind the locked door
The sleeping dog you beat
I hope I see the day
She satisfies her teeth

Give back to the native
Their treaty land
What you preach you preach for others
Why don't you practice that firsthand

I just don't understand
This world of mine
I must be out of touch
Or out of my mind
And will the profits of destruction
Forever make your eyes blind
Do you bow to the corporations
'Cause they pay their bills on time

Here we go, beat down round 2
Heads up punk 'cause it all comes down to

Put you on the streets wit ya jingling hoes

You're young and dumb and quick at the tongue
You high strung bum come and get done
I'll do you wit a death blow

Kill 'em kill 'em
I'll hit ya wit a death blow

My lyrical beatdown will leave ya in a coma

Your brain is fatigued, you're out of your league
You're running out of gas and you're tank is on E
Somebody buy him a heart 'cause he's petro
Take you're whipping like a man brother let go
No apologies, tears, or violins
Get your black suits 'cause I ain't smiling
I'm shooting the gift of gab, brother you're ripped in half
Soon as the mic is past, you won't live to laugh
If there's laughter, I'll get the last one
You loafed on the lyrics and you caught a bad one
So who's got no style, look at your profile
You can't dance, can't dress and you're so foul
Still wearing played out 4 finger rings
Played out fat gold chains and things
You changed your look now change your gameplan
Trying to dress but you still wear name brand
Brother, you look crazy weak
And it gets worse when we hear you speak
So you ain't got a chance in hell
You'll be known as the late LL
The man who lost one, one too often
Came wit a soft one and went to his coffin
A close casket they won't show ya
When I finish, you're mama won't know ya
'Cause I'm a rip you limb from limb
You tombstone read he had no win
So RIP, Rest in peace, rip 'em
D.I.D., dead indeed, did 'em
A H-I-T, hitman, so whatcha hit 'em wit

You can't win and that (record scratch) knew it
I'm a send you home in a body bag
Wit the mic in your throat and a jock for a gag

And Marly marl can't save you from fallin
'Cause as soon as you came back what did you do
To the break of dawn, another dumb move
You can't go hard, you're just so-so Todd
I'm that type of guy, oh my God
It's gets no rougher comes no weaker
marly hooked the beats so now you need a
Writer to bring you back from hell
Because I'm a rock up L

Laps language latent lurking
Language, language, local logo
Light laboring, limited local

I watched you fall like Hitler fell
And now you're down to a broken L
You're records ain't hot and you're shows don't sell
Yo, tell 'em how you fell L, hard as hell

Martina McBride,Anything's Better Than Feelin' The Blues,"(Matrica Berg/Randy Scruggs)

I sent myself a dozen roses
Right before the office closes
Just to make my girlfriends green with envy
Ever since I lost you
All the crazy things I do
I didn't even know I had it in me.. Oh but

Hey it's all right
It's just another Saturday night
Got nobody.. got no nothin to lose
I'm gonna get dressed up and go downtown
Spread a little misery round
Anything's better than feelin the blues

Found a restaurant on my way
Told 'em it was my birthday
Just to hear the waiters sing off-key
I've sprung a loose wire.. that's a fact
Got a strange little monkey on my back
But I kinda like the company.. and I guess

Hey, it's all right
It's just another Saturday night
Got nobody.. got no nothin to lose.
I'm gonna get dressed up and go downtown
Dance the little monkey around
Anything's better than feelin' the blues

Hey it's alright. 
It's just another Saturday night
Got nobody... got no nothin to lose.  
I'm gonna get dressed up and go down town
Live it up and never live it down
Anything's better than feelin' the blues

To be something so miniscule.
Everything i thought was so definite,
I thought was so real was thrown away and will be remembered among unpaling hatred.

Consider my suffering. 
Through all your pain. 
Remember my face. 
I'm digging your grave. 
Since when was so sacred, 
turning into something so wrong.
something so important to me. 
Cheapened and exploited.
I won't be that way, I can't, I can't be that way again.
I can't, I won't, I will never let it.

Fairweather companions have left you all alone

And in each situation you know

He never changes, He's always the same
Through all the ages, He always remains
Forever constant, forever a friend
Forever faithful, His love knows no end
He never changes, He's always the same

A God so amazing I can't comprehend
The depth of His mercies such grace that has no end
I'm awed by the thought that I'm formed in the image of Him
But my humanity brings me down to my knees
And I find that's when His strength begins

There'a cold and lonely winter wind that's bound to blow

Remember when we used to park it in the lane
And listen to the country radio
We'd hold on to each other while the singer sang
And we'd stay like that 'til it was time to go

Now it makes me sad to think the good old days are gone
Although our love is still as strong today
But the world would have a lot more lovers hanging on
If they still made '57 Chevrolets

Thrice,All That's Left,"One day the dreamers died within us

We hid the truth beneath our skin but
Our shadows never looked the same

A ghost is all that's left 
Of everything we swore we never would forget
We tried to bleed the sickness, but we drained our hearts instead
We are, we are the dead

And when we couldn't stop the bleeding
We held our hearts over the flame
We couldn't help but call it treason
After that we couldn't fill our frames
After that our shadows never looked the same

A ghost is all that's left
Of everything we swore we never would forget
We tried to bleed the sickness, but we drained our hearts instead

With higher pitch and perfect aim 
And standing fast, we'd radiate
A light we loved but never named
But the answers never came 
Our shadows never looked the same

Of everything we swore we never would forget (Can we be saved?)

We are, we are the dead (We are the ones who lost our faith)

From the Northern Kingdom comes a faint sound
Growing stronger here before the hearth
The chorus of the King has come to heal your heart

In your heart, there's a world of sadness
I love you with all heart
In your heart with my words I promise
To love you with all heart,

Electric Light Orchestra,Queen Of The Hours (2001 Digital Remaster),"Queen of the hours lies waiting for the wind
To blow away the veil of time
Slowly now the threads of age
Are starting to unwind

Queen of the hours, along, along, along
The path of time, of time
She is still, the clock shall tell the tale
When all is well, is well

Black was the night that came in from the East
And caused the land to sleep
Riding on a storm
It carved a message in Isabella Creek

Queen of the hours, along, along, along
The path of time, of time
She is still, the clock shall tell the tale
When all is well, is well

Dawn is the death wish night has passed away
It left the sacred flower
Opened up the grave and bowed
Its life unto the queen of hours",sad,1971

I still be the thuggish ruggish, nigga. Dressed in all black khakis, fatigues, 
and boots. Still don't give a fuck about the law. Still run with a pump in my 
car and fuck who you are! You fuckin' with a couple of niggas that's really 
insane. I'm talkin' loco, Krayzie as hell—it ain't just a name—It's the game. 
We done loosened up a couple strings and shook a couple of screws loose in my 
brain. Besides that, man ain't nothin' changed. Look at me now, I'm still a 
thug, nigga I still smoke bud. (You know) You know I still represent St. Clair 
wig-split, shit, nigga what? This is Bone Thug. Niggas thinkin' I told ya but 
we put it down like that. And whoever we got to fuck up to prove that we do it, 
and keep on movin'. Guess who's back up in the house? Original Cleveland 
criminals niggas just send 'em subliminal messages like ""Murda, Mo Murda 
Murda!"" Never forgot where we come from. Watch how you move your tongue. Cause 
I got niggas that's ready to jump off in your ass and smash and crash. Protect 
my niggas for 
combat, Leather Face at 'cha and on your ass like I was a heat-seeker, quickly

I be the smoothest lil' nigga, you can meet me (me). But nigga, you fuck with 
me, then I'ma fuck with you. Introduce you to this heat. I sweep the street. 
When I draw down, let me hear ya say ""Fuck the Law!"" now. Rawest niggas in the 
town, ready to thug and go down. ""Go pound for pound,"" nigga that's the motto. 
Let me see you throw them things and if it's real, nigga, keep it real. Show me 
your game. I'm sure gon' claim what the fuck is mine, my nigga I'll take it. 
Grab a player-hater by the neck, choke him out and try to break it. Gimme your 
money, drop them keys, it's a jack-move bitch! And since you haters ain't got 
no business that's how we attack your shit. Nigga we'll smack your bitch in the 
middle of the Grammy. And the media might ban me. Nigga this Mo Thug Family is 
for real.

And you wanna get rid of a hood bitch with game. And every bitch said I'm a 
good bitch fuckin' with my wood grain. Everybody still playin' that hood game 
quiet. (quiet, quiet, quiet) Especially when it's tired. My environment ain't 
nothin' but niggas dyin' in them chemical-fed injections in Jasper, Texas. 
Split up these niggas off in different sections. Don't hate my message. Destiny 
led to mimic, chastity for my daughter. Wad up a nigga's sherm, and come listen 
to the sermon. Swervin' in my Surburban, lick it up with the bottle. But 
everybody know I got some problems. Had dreams of the Apollo. The fiends had 
faith in me. Suckas wouldn't run. A nigga not insane. Niggas still with 
me—Bone. Somehow they turn up. Run up and get your sign. Run blindly, elevate 
through time, nowhere to hide.

Our dawgs finna haul off lead, sawed-off head. Nigga, you drippin', soakin' 
with bloodly body be beggin' me. You know what you should've capped like 2Pac 
with a glock. They're deadly. Better not upset my thug mentality, sucka. You 
know you done fucked up, don't you niggas? Runnin' up blastin' gas craters. 
What the fuck you thought you saw with your head in the sky? Could it be a 
bird, or maybe it's even a plane. For the untamed, insane human, only the 5th 
Dawg. Fuck you thought, muthafuck fame, for the fact the shit is a phat game 
goin' remain number one in the Land. Flesh, strangle the gang. Bang-bang, bang! 
I dropped five guards in the name of the Lord, I say. Now how many times will I 
have to slay today? Will I raise my guage? Oh God ! How will I teach 'cha, but 
it's these tactics that he daily practice. They gonna let you. Don't have it? 
Have it! Runnin' up you sons of bastards! Blast it! We sons of assassins, match 
it, collecting more cash. That's true, you're feeling that, niggas said all my 
babies ge
t a million. Struggle with a villian, hit ‘em with a venomous blow! I call on 
my mighty archangel. Gonna surround my soul, but go with the calico yo! We the 
tightest, you know Mo' the Mighty. Yes, trues humbly united. My family never 
divided: Desperado, Thug Line, Mo Thug, Millennium, 7th Sign. For the FBI, you 
wanna come test my Enterprise? Bitch, you better go think twice, and open up 
your muthafuckin' eyes! These niggas can't fuck with the 5th Dawg, finna 
parlay! Everyday stormin' your way, you better lay low, so you might just duck 
when I buck guage! Can't you see my niggas having a ball all day. Since we

Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds,Christina The Astonishing (2010 Digital Remaster),"Christina the Astonishing
Lived a long time ago
She was stricken with a seizure
At the age of twenty-two

They took her body in a coffin
To a tiny church in Liege
Where she sprang up from the coffin
Just after the Agnus Dei

She soared up to the rafters
Perched on a beam up there
Cried ""The stink of human sin
Is more that I can bear""

Christina the Astonishing
Was the most astonishing of all
She prayed balanced on a hurdle
Or curled up into a ball

She fled to remote places
Climbed towers and trees and walls
To escape the stench of human corruption
Into an oven she did crawl

O Christina the Astonishing
Behaved in a terrifying way
She would run wildly through the streets
Jump in the Meusse and swim away

O Christina the Astonishing
Behaved in terrifying manner
Died at the age of seventy-four
In the convent of St Anna",sad,1992

Foghat,Zig-Zag Walk,"Dave Peverett - Pevwrite Music - ASCAP

The way you walk ain't walkin', it's something mama don't allow.
Let your hips do the talkin', and pretend you don't know how.
Ruby red, oh baby blue,
Heaven knows what I can for you,
When you're out there, doin' the Zig-Zag Walk.

Stiletto heels in stockin's, trace the seam up to the top.
And you're daring me to touch you, but I won't know where to stop.
A little rude, that's what you say,
It must be hard to keep the wolves at bay,
When you're out there, doin' the Zig-Zag Walk.

Zig-zag, well it's my kinda move,
Big drag if I can't cut the groove,
No stone gonna be unturned,
When you're walkin', walkin' and a-talkin',
Baby, doin' the Zig-Zag Walk.
Uh, doin' that walk.

The way we love ain't lovin', don't do nothin' for my heart.
Just a physical attraction, you're the bulls-eye - I'm the dart.
At least I know the way you feel,
Don't care nothing for a love that's real,
When you're out there, doin' the Zig-Zag Walk.

Zig-zag, walk like Marilyn Monroe,
Zig-zag, talk like Brigitte Bardot,
No stone gonna be unturned,
When you're out there, walkin' and a talkin',
Baby, doin' the Zig-Zag Walk.

I said baby, doin' the Zig-Zag Walk,
Doin' that walk...
Mmmm, fontastique!
Ooh la la la!

The Lord asked me would I do His will
I told Him yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes

I'm presenting my body, a living sacrifice
All I'm gonna do is the will of Christ
I was asked this question and the answer is yes

The question is when will Jesus return?
I want you to know soon, soon
Soon, soon, soon, soon

Look at the crisis in Iran
Russia's already invaded Afghanistan
Soon, soon, soon, soon, soon, soon

Oh, but I can hardly wait for Jesus to return
For His returning my heart of yearn
I was asked this question and the answer is real soon

Now the questions are will I ever leave You
Will I do Your will and when will Jesus return?
No and yes and soon, soon, soon, soon

Will I ever leave You, will I do Your will
When will Jesus return

That you're really sorry
And ask to be in my life again

I didn't have the strenght to live
But I was just too young to die
See I have had my heart broken before
But never like this
I admit it baby left me feeling scorned
Now the love inside my heart is fading
The trust of my man and my best friend betrayed

Or start love over

I wonder what happened to my nigga, cock block
I hate to see ya young ox, but up in a box
He became a dread cause he had a lock
On the flock in the place all on my jock
Cause I had grace
Told cock block he could hop many women
Upon them never ever release your semen
Upon them is a materialized demon
Illustrious, succubus, do not trust
She see you when you coming
She know you wanna bust
Now she got you sippin on the clitorus, juice
Some of them juices is poisonous, juice
Shoulda took notes, when the master spoke
Places in the pussy, you can provoke
You got what you want
Your soul is ghost, ghost, ghost, ghost

Simply Red,So Not Over You (Motivo-Pop Lectro Mix),"Don't know why I still slept on my side of the bed,
The emptiness when you were gone
Kept ringing in my head, 
Told myself I really had to move along,
Stop regretting all the things I left unsaid.

So I tore up your letters,
Took your picture off the wall.
I deleted your number,
It was too hard not to call.
And then I told myself that I would be fine
Gotta live for the good times.

'Cause everywhere I go there's a love song that reminds me of you,
And even though I knew I had to be strong I'm still not over you
'Cause I still believe and could see how there's nothing left of you and me.
Our time is over,
But I'm so not over you.

All my friends tried to tell me
That I'd find somebody new.
Why waste time being lonely,
When there's nothing left to loose.
Anything to get you out of my mind.
I'm a fool if I thought I could forget,
And I could not forget.

'Cause everywhere I go there's a love song that reminds me of you,
And even though I knew I had to be strong I'm still not over you
'Cause I still believe and could see how there's nothing left of you and me.
Our time is over.
But I'm so not over you.

Now I found a way to keep you there beside me,
To where my love for you cannot be denied.
I can only hope to keep you there to guide me,
There's no more need to hide from all this pain inside.

'Cause everywhere I go there's a love song that reminds me of you,
And even though I knew I had to be strong I'm still not over you.
'Cause I still believe and could see how there's nothing left of you and me.
Our time is over.
But I'm so not over you.",sad,2007
Bon Jovi,Only Lonely,"Another long and sleepless night 
You need someone to hold you tight 
Sometimes love don't know wrong from right 
Another long and senseless 
Fight was all you knew they're all the same 
There's no one left to take the blame 
What's behind this masquerade 
How do we win these losin' 
Games we play, words we say 
Cutting wounds we know they run so deep 
Leave it all behind you 
Or someday love will find you 

Only lonely -- I can't stop hurting you 
Only lonely -- but I can't stop loving you 
Only lonely -- how much pain does it take 

It's getting sometimes I don't know 
When to stop when to go 
Sometimes we're so afraid to let it show 
A stolen kiss so out of place 
It wipes the smile right off your face 
And when those feelings start 
We let them go, let them go 

Games we play, words we say 
Cutting wounds that run so deep 
Leave it all behind you 
Or someday love will find you 

Only lonely -- I can't stop hurting you 
Only lonely -- but I can't stop loving you 
Only lonely -- so tell me babe, how much pain 
Can you take before your heart breaks? 

I got this timebomb ticking in my head 
This time I think she's gonna blow 
How can I say get away 
When I just can't let go 

Games we play, words we say 
Cutting wounds that run so... 
Leave it all behind you 
Or someday love will find you 

Only lonely -- I can't stop hurting you 
Only lonely -- but I can't stop loving you 
Only lonely -- how much pain does it take",sad,1985

Reminds me of childhood memories
Where everything was as fresh
As the bright blue sky

Now and then when I see her face
She takes me away to that special place
And if I stare too long
I'd probably break down and cry

Woah oh oh, sweet child o' mine
Woah oh oh oh, sweet love of mine

She's got eyes of the bluest skies
And if they thought of rain
I'd hate to look into those eyes
And see an ounce of pain

Her hair reminds me of a warm, safe place
Where as a child I'd hide
And pray for the thunder and the rain
To quietly pass me by

Woah oh oh, sweet child o' mine
Woah oh oh oh, sweet love of mine

Needs a reason to kill man

The reason he must attain
Must be approved by his God

I guess that I'll take it one thing at a time
still sometimes I can't help but wonder why... 
I sit around all day and I waste my whole damn life away
still thinkin' bout' just what there is to say. 

Should I say goodnight? 
go to bed, turn out the fucking light 
and leave you shining in the past. 
Should I try and forget? 
even though next week it's something I'll regret. 
Or, should I try and make it last? 

I think about the day when I felt you'd throw it all away
to try and make me feel like I'm the one. 
You were my best friend 
and I never ever thought those days would end
but now it seems like they are gone. 

What more can I say? 
I never wanted it to be this way, 
and where the hell is yesterday? 
We sure had a blast!

Winds Of Plague,Origins And Endings,"It begins when the time comes in 
And brings forth a dead current
A motion set for certain demise

We watched them come from the depths 
But we couldn't see it till we looked in their eyes
Behind the mask, the demon resides
The meat was stripped from their bones

We destroy!

Burn it all down
Put them back underground 
This is a day that I promise
You will not forget

With the heart of a warrior, 
I rise with all I have left

I watched as the walls crumbled backed 
Backed with a burning sky, legions fell
They left with a mission complete
Genocide fulfilled; leave me for dead

Miscreation of revenge beats through my veins
Empires that once rivaled us fell from the sky
Beg for life as you return to the Earth

The world will bow to me",sad,2008

Cant we try one more time?

The Mighty Mighty Bosstones,Pictures To Prove It,"Well you insisted the day you walked away
That we shared nothing, but I've got something
That I'd still like to say
You're not here to listen, and we were never good at that

I hit the bottle, put the pictures on the bar
I'll always have these pictures, but I don't know where you are

I've got a whole stack of proof
I've got pictures to prove it, I've got, I've got

Pictures to prove it, 
Smudged with fingerprints and tears
Cigarette ashes
And our first few happy years
They're old now, they're faded
And the edges all are frayed
I'll always have these pictures
But I wish that you had stayed

If you saw them, I'm sure
You'd be forced to remember
What we don't have anymore
I've got a pile of pictures
I've got a whole stack of proof
I've got pictures to prove it and all I ever do is

Stare at the pictures for hours on end
They tell the truth to me
While I'm sure you just pretend
And you deny we ever happened and swear it never was that way
Even you'll admit when I submit to you exhibit A

Love, love is what we make it

Feel each beat's demand 
Your paper skin 
And the universe that echoes within 

And I will always be aware

But at least I'm someone to lean on

Whatever happende to our future
Cause I can see it in the rear view
Wathever happened to me
Whatever happened to you

Gotta look myself in the eye
And say it's gonna be alright
Maybe everything won't be alright
All the time
I've gotta take these chances where they are
It's gonna be alright
I've gotta see things for what they are
At the time

Lost with no place to begin
I'll slowly adjust to the sun just face I'm in

Whatever happened to the list
of things I wanted to be
Whatever happened to you
Whatever happened to me

Gotta look myself in the eye
And say it's gonna be alright
Maybe everything won't be alright
All the time
I've gotta take these chances where they are
And it's gonna be alright
I've gotta see things for what they are
At the time, at the time

Yeah the words are on the seam
Ready to receive
I'm the ocean you're the stream
Ready to receive
It's like open arms to me
Ready to, ready to receive

Gotta look myself in the eye
And say it's gonna be alright
Maybe everything won't be alright
All the time
No, I've gotta take these chances where they are
And it's gonna be alright
I've gotta see things for what they are
At the time
I've gotta see things for what they are
At the time,
At the time",sad,2009
He Is Legend,Stampede,"We have been moving
To cuts and bruises
I'll sing a song for you
Run faster or you'll lose it
This is our heartbeat
Our words are so sweet
You dropped your medicine
Inside the water that we drink
Mama, tell me do I have a fever?

From the west I see the warrior sleep
And from the eat I watch the witches bathe my feet
I headed north and saw you dancing in the rain
I woke up in the south and I will never be the same
Mama, tell me do I have a fever?

I looked left to find your fingerprints were gone
I look right to something was going wrong
I looked up to see the sun had flickered out
I headed down the road that lead me to the south

Oh Lord, This road I travel
Has made my head unravel
I just want to go home
But this road won't let me go

Country road
Take me home
To the place
Where I belong
I'm so homesick
And I can't see straight
I'm not gonna make it
It's getting too late

Has made my head unravel
I just want to go home

He's been with you
You were raised in the church
so you know I'm tellin the truth
Livin like you don't know right from wrong
tellin yourself you're okay
God's word is always right
Just admit you've left the way
So I'm here to tell ya
it doesn't matter what you've done or where you been
Just fall on your knees, confess and he will forgive your sins

(chorus)
Come on back home, you've been away too long
God has been good to you
He's brought you through and through
Why can't you see the signs
We're living at the end
Jesus is coming soon
Don't wait too late my friend

Just surrender and stop the fight
Go head and throw in the towel
Why run from love any longer
When you're almost out of time
Let him restore you
And break up that fallow ground
All power is in his hands
To turn your whole life around
Let him in your heart
The choice is yours you don't have to be ashamed

(chorus)

Please don't ignore the knocking at your door
Let him in your heart, he'll forget the past and give a fresh new start
And this time hold on, don't let him, don't let him, don't let him go
He wants to wash you and fill you and heal you and love you like...

How many wishes going on and on and on and on.

Blue makes you colourblind
Beware of it, beware of it

You talk about a rumour
You talk about dead-end streets
About this rumour
Its not the way to think
Talk about a rumour 
Then talk about a higher love 
You know it won't 
It won't satisfy my needs
It won't satisfy my needs
Say ne, ne, ne, ne, ne, ne, ne

Talk about a rumour

No one expected this
That I should falter in a maudlin sky
No one expected this
But I misjudged and aimed to high
Blue is a sacred place
Where shattered dreams find shelter, well
Blue is a state of mind
Blue makes you colour-blind

You talk about a rumour
You talk about dead-end streets
About this rumour
It's God in me
So, if you talk about a rumour
Then talk about a higher love
You talk about a rumour
When all it takes is simple love
And love and love and love and love
Simple love
And love and love and love and love
You're too high
Blue makes you colour-blind, yeah
Yeah hehe, love ....",happy,1996

And how you need your space and give the keys back to your door 
And how I cry and try and try to make you stay with me 
But still you said the love was gone and that I had to leave

What's that number for b go-a-go-a-gone 

Lord knows it wasn't easy believe me 
Never thought you'd be the one that would deceive me 
And never do what your suppose to do 
No need to punch me boo cause I won't play you cause

From loneliness to a wedding ring
I played an Ace and I won a Queen
And walked away with your heart

From a Jack to a King
With no regret I stacked the cards last night
And lady luck played her hand just right
To make me King of your heart
For just a little while
I thought that I might lose the game
Then just in time
I saw the twinkle in your eye

From a Jack to a King
From loneliness to a wedding ring
I played an Ace and I won a Queen
You made me King of your heart

Well you got a hot date and you wanna be fly 
Throw on a Gucci blazer and a Gucci tie 
Not a hair out of place,a freshly-shaved face 
You think you're walkin' out the house with style and grace 
(Don't you) 
You pick up your girl and take her to dinner 
'Cause when the night is over you think you're gonna win her 
Then you move real close using all your charm 
And then your girl says ""Baby guess that"" 

(I smell your underarms) 

That odor,it's ringin' out loud and clear as a bell 
You can't hear it because you're immune to the smell 
I describe your aroma as foul and pathetic 
And they can use your odor as the latest anesthetic 
Now I know that it's stone cold funk,I can tell 
'Cause it's written all over by the way you smell 
That funk the aroma,that smell,that scent 
You'll be arrested for malicious body odor intent 
Your odor going 'round,doin' people bodily harm 
And then somebody turned around and  said 

(I smell your underarms) 

You woke up late for work usin' the same old line 
Don't think I'm gonna wash my underarms this time 
The more you ignore,the worse the smell grows 
And you pick out all clothes by using your nose 
It was the rush hour when I was on the train 
And the smell of underarms was drivin' me insane 
It was a sure-fire way of bringing me to my death 
I couldn't hold a conversation,I was holding my breath 
And you cold see the funk just like a cloud in the air 
Was homeboy sittin' next to me,I swear! 
And when I saw the direction this girl was leaning 
You could hear homebody's underarms just screaming 
(ugh.....) 

(I smell your underarms) 

Hanging at a party one night,all alone 
Sippin' on a bottle of Dom Perignon 
The crowd was on the floor,rocking the beat 
Smelling like thay ain't bathed since last week 
The smell was all through the house,cold rockin' the place 
The funk fill the air like a fresh can of Mace 
When you raised your hands I had to sound tha alarm 
A girl said ""Look,there's Monster growin under his arm"" 
We were so shocked we couldn't even run (uhgh) 
And they declared  his arm public enemy number one 
Now throw your hands in the air,if you want to party hard 
Now put your hands back down,everybody's,'cause 
You didn't use Right Guard

See them ease out of the circle
Watch your friends run and hide
Help them fall back in this cycle

Here we are searching...

Look in the eye of the test

EPMD,For My People,"Hereeeeeee we go....

Verse One: Erick Sermon

The E-R-I-C-K S-E-R-M-O-N
I'm dark skinned, pack a mac 10
More menace and I'll wreck the whole damn set
Smash (yes) you ain't seen *shit* yet
Yes, a fact, a black nine mil is what I pack
In the front of my waist, right next to my bozack
A safety, for the suckers that hate me
I haven't had to bust a couple of rounds lately
I hope not, it's no fun getting shot
Cause when I cock, I aim straight for the knot
I don't miss, I have a scope, no jokin
You should hope, that disco appearance like broke
Mass destruction when I start crushin and bustin
Duck MC's, I'm bumrushin
Swift wit the trig, there's nuff foes equipped
Real deal, of course, I pack steel, shit's thick
I'm not dumb, to walk the streets, they kept us swinging by
A punk chump wit spunk, who dares to jump
By the hour, I push power like Hiroshima
Got dropped on by USA and like cleaned her
I manage to damage people without a sequel
This is for my people

Verse Two: PMD

Check out the main attraction, black man in action
Number one crowd mover, I break backs in
Boy, you shoulda known what EPMD stands for
Sucker snappin necks, bustin caps, and breakin jaws
It's Erick and Parrish Making Dollars
Excel, living well, taking no shorts and why bother
to whine while I dine, sounds genuine
You walked in wrong camp, punk, stepped on a landmine
Boom bang, bust the slang that I bring
From Brentwood, Long Island, all the way to Sing-Sing
Yes the penile, peace to brothers on trial
For some *bullshit* charge, mugshot on file
For hard time, thump beats like an Alpine
No Sam Suey sole shoe shoot joints, back a tech nine
Yes the brother's back wit no knife or ax
Just a microphone, sucker, it limits that pack
Def blows and flows, quadraverbs and echoes
Sounds the pound hard to make an MC petrol
My nine mil, kitted wit the infrared beam
Something similar to a Roger Moore scene
That's James Bond, 007, wit guillotine
To keep the Hit Squad hype to fly heads like the A-Team
Don't bug or miss, bug on the sequel
For this *shit* I kick, it's strictly for my people

Naughty's been known for bringin major niggas max of stress
Never want us in yo party cos we crack yo set
Little juvenile delinquent gets a classic vet
Somebody come and grab yo child before I snap his neck
Uuh! Yeah! You motherfuckers disgrace me
I'll make money but the money don't make me
Niggas like you be always actin so flakey
Chess while you runnin round yo hood, don't shake ya

Jerry taps some more caps, ooh where you goin
Reapin in somebody half six in the mornin

Bitch rollin through the front fence, strollin through my back
If Vin move the llello, continue to lay low

Could've been on the payroll, but you wanna play bro

Janet Jackson,Again (Instrumental),"I heard from a friend today
And she said you were in town
Suddenly the memories came back to me
In my mind

How can I be strong?
I've asked myself
Time and time I've said
That I'll never fall in love with you again

A wounded heart you gave
My soul you took away
Good intentions you had many
I know you did

I come from a place that hurts
And God knows how I've cried
And I never want to return
Never fall again

Making love to you felt so good
And oh so right

How can I be strong?
I've asked myself
Time and time I've said
That I'll never fall in love with you again

So here we are alone again
Didn't think it'd come to this
And to know it all began
With just a little kiss

I've come too close to happiness
To have it swept away
Don't think I can take the pain
Never fall again

Kinda late in the game
And my heart is in your hands
Don't you stand there and then tell me
You love me, then leave again
'Cause I'm falling in love with you again

Hold me, hold me
Don't ever let me go
Say it just one time
Say you love me
God knows I do love you again",sad,1993

looking back across the sky,

knowing that I just left it all behind

how did she go,

I wanna know
I wanna know that she'll be coming 
here to me

Come on, 
without you 
I'll never feel the love inside of me
Come On, you know that we belong

Thinking back before her,
I never knew the meaning of alone

I live the day to escape into a phone
Speaking of a world not real then
where did she go 
how did she go, 
I wanna

I wanna know that she'll be coming

Come on, 
without you 
I'll never feel the love inside of me
Come On, you know that we belong
come on, come on, come on, come on

Cause each of her kisses and my heart misses . . .
She's coming, 
She's coming here to me, 
I'm needing,
desiring to kiss her now, 
I'm living for her,
breathing for her, 
singing for her fairytale.

Come on, 
without you 
I'll never feel the love inside of me
Come On, you know that we belong

Roger Creager,All For The Sake Of The Song,"Clay Blaker/Tommy Connors

Her name was Stella
And she was old and gray
She had her rusty strings and keys
And the tuner, it took a pair of pliers 
And lots of elbow grease
She awakened me to the melody 
Like the light from a brand new dawn
And from that moment on
It was all for the sake of the song

Her name was Maggie
She had eyes like fire
That burned for me in the dark
And all she wanted was my very soul 
And all she could take from my heart
But to her dismay a choice was made
And when the deed was done
She turned and I was gone
It was all for the sake of the song

And for the sake of the song
I walk my own road
For the sake of the song
Not for silver and gold
Some may think that I am wrong
But in my heart I know
And I've known all along
It was all for the sake of the song

Her name was Laura
She was pure like crystal
Shining alone on the shelf
And from the moment that her eyes met mine
I knew there could be nobody else
Kindred souls singing free in perfect harmony
Two hearts now beat as one
The road goes on and on
And it's all for the sake of the song

For the sake of the song
I walk my own road
For the sake of the song
Not for silver and gold
Some may think that I am wrong
But in my heart I know
And I've known all along
It was all for the sake of the song

And I guess there's nothing more to say
Love can make you blind, make you act so strange

Do you ever wonder why (everyday...)
why I love everything about you

But everyday I say I'll try 
to make my heart be still
'til then every way there is to cry
ourselves to sleep we will

It picked me up, knocked me off my feet
I've got no way to explain
Still I love you, love you, love you but this fire inside
Will never see the light of day

You'll never know
No you'll never see

But I know that things won't change
How we feel, how life goes on
And that seems so strange

And so the light fades away (everyday...)
Try, try, try as I may (everyday...)

Life In Your Way,When Rules Change,"To the author of this dream
I can't say I know all the answers
I'm short on so many things
But I know the choices we make will make us who we are
Can we be brave again?
To put a foot down for what's right?
These things we strive to have will fall to the worth of the dirt we walk on
More or less a chasing after the wind
A kind of ignorance the bright despise
Leaving their face without a disguise
Let them know that this is the last time
Let them know they put themselves to shame
Let them know
There is a movement, a movement in the air
Can you feel it?
Could we be brave again and not step aside?
If I had to, would I stand alone?",happy,2005

FFH,Listen,"Voices are everywhere, and they're screaming at us: use me, buy me, believe me.  We've got voices all over our culture: chat rooms, commercials, billboards, and bumper stickers, and they all want our immediate attention.

And then there is that voice from the past or that voice in your head that says you messed up too many times.  You can't do it.  You can't do it on your own.  You're not smart enough.  You're not strong enough.  You're not stable enough.  You're not thin enough.  And then there's the enemy.  The father of lies that likes to get in there and say no way you'll ever make anything of yourself.

I had this amazing conversation with my dad not too long ago.  He's a great man.  I love him so much.  And he told me about the first time that his father said something encouraging to him.  My dad had just put a room onto his house.  And my grandfather was a master carpenter and he was inspecting my dad's work.  And he got done and went to my dad, and said, ""That's a good job Harry.""  And that was the first time my grandfather said something encouraging to my dad, and he was 38 years old.

Man, and without hearing that voice.  Without hearing that, whether it's the actually the physical audible voice of your father or mother, or the voice from God, you don't have any identity.  You have no way to function.  I think Jesus knew that.  I think that's why, when He went through His ministry, touching people and healing people, and speaking to people.  He never asked them to be anything that they weren't.  He tried to get them to understand who they were.  That's why he said, ""You're my daughter, you're my son, you're my brother, you're my sheep.""  He wanted us to identify with Him and understand that we're His creation; that we're worth something.



Yeah, and that's something amazing about Jesus.  He could look down into somebody's spirit and draw out who they really were.  I mean, he looked at Simon and said, ""You know what?  You're not Simon, You're Peter.  You're a Rock.""

And how 'bout that woman that came up to Him when He was going through that crowd, and she touched His garment, and he turned around and he said, ""Daughter.""  His first word: Daughter. 

You know, Jesus got that honestly from His father.  Three times when Jesus was under immense pressure in his ministry, God the father actually spoke.  I mean, spoke audibly, It wasn't inward.  Jesus heard it, and the people around Jesus heard it.  Like at His baptism, God the father said, ""you are my son, I love you and I'm pleased with you.""  And then at the transfiguration, the father spoke again and the disciples heard it.  The father said, ""You are my son.  I have chosen you, and God just established Christ's purpose on that mountain.""  And then, before Christ died at Gethsemane in John 12, Jesus prayed: should I pray to be delivered from this hour?  No.  This is why I've come.  Glorify your name father.  And the father spoke and said, ""I have glorified it, and I will glorify it again.""  And I think that promise just drove Christ to the cross.  

I think it did too.  You may have never heard that voice.  That voice that says you're worth it.  You're smart enough.  I believe in you.  I love you.  There may be a gaping hole in your spirit where that voice was supposed to speak into, and it's just a vacuum.  Listen, Jesus doesn't require anything of you.  You can't work to get His approval.  Remember, when he was affirmed by His father, when God looked down and said, ""This is my son who I love.""  Jesus hadn't done a single miracle.  All he asks of you is that you listen.",sad,2005

Everybody's gettin' richer sellin' that dope

Along with seven million people without a hope

Well, I was raised on a back street,
Time's were tough, but kind of bittersweet.
Left school when I was still a child,
Hit the streets and started running wild.
Hanging out in the neighborhood,
People said, ""They're up to no good!""
Never thought I'd ever make it through,
Hey boy, what you gonna do?

Crosstown traffic, sirens wailing, screaming in my ear.
It's got me on the run, gotta move on out of here.

I'm on a dead end street, on a dead end street,
Well it's got me beat, on a dead end street.
I can't go no further, won't somebody rescue me,
From this dead end street, oh yeah.

They still talk about the big fight,
On the backstreet at midnight.
Everybody heard the gunfire,
Saw him dragged into the Black Maria.
Now my best friend is doing time,
He's committed to a life of crime.
Got a feeling I'll be next in line,
I wonder how can I get out in time?

I stepped into a movie, this can't be reality.
If I wasn't so lucky, I wonder where I'd be?

I'm on a dead end street, on a dead end street,
Well it's got me beat, on a dead end street.
I can't go no further, won't somebody rescue me,
From this dead end street, oh yeah.

Scoping lightning from his pores
Keeping time, with his hurricane beat

In the battle between God or the Devil
I lay claim to your spirit, your religion, your belief system
I'll do your hit in your kitchen and you're relief pitchin

The man of your dreams and your nightmares commandin your vision

First time I heard him, I was in Japan
Seems like the first time I heard him was like, the Reflection, Reflection Eternal
Like when Kanye came out I guess was when I started to listen, I hate to say that but
New York native, and serious Talib fan
I came all the way from Puerto Rico just to see Talib Kweli
Him, Mos Def all of them man, I need them out here in my life

Open Hand,Tough Guy,"I feel like I've lost trust in everyone,
They say deception is the key.

I want to go with you now,
I need to step away,
That's if your going my way,
I've failed again but it's ok,
The situations upside down for me.

I feel like I've lost touch with everyone,
My perception is unclear,
I'll see if I can go with you again,
Things change, the old cliche,
""How's it going, same as yesterday"",

I want to go with you now,
I need to step away,
That's if your going my way,
I've failed again but it's ok,
The situations upside down for me,

I feel so run down inside... I feel so run down.

I feel like I've lost trust in everyone,
They say deception is the key.

I want to go with you now,
I need to step away,
That's if your going my way,
I've failed again but it's ok,

should I save it up inside? 
Oh man, I hope I have the time,
And I want to let you know how far I was willing to go.",sad,2004
EPMD,I'm Mad,"Erick Sermon:
It's the E, and I'm smokin'. Wild like Tone Loc, I'm roastin, bakin' MCs,
the E I'm not jokin' so back up, punk, slack up.
Watch your weak posse, before they get smacked up.
One by ONE, two by TWO, three by THREE, Yo P...
(Parrish: What's Up, E.D.?)
Pass the Uzi, to blow up, any wack MC that show up, 
there goes one, blast 'im now.
(E, hold up.)
*Don't make me wait-wait* because it might be too late, the punk might escape,
and buck whyle, and in fact, bite my style, and I'm-a catch a bullshit charge,
plus trial.
It's my thing to swing, your first mistake to bring a duck MC that can't hang.
Don't forget, I'm crazy swift. My name is Erick Sermon
(yeah, and I'm Parrish Smith)
I could act foolish, start blastin'. Ha ha ha ha, now who's laughin'?
I'm-a let ya slide, but ya owe me, next time you see me...
(...holler like ya know me!)
I'm mad... 

Refrain:
(Here's a little story, I've gots to tell) {scratching} (I'm mad!) 4x 

Parrish:
My life story I tell straight from the heart.
When suckers tried to crash my shit straight from start.
A young black kid destined for success, no Old Gold, no cocaine, or buddha cess.
Straight up hard work. No sleep and no shorts.
Brainstormin' with the skills that Pop Duke taught.
To keep swingin', yeah, and not to quit.
Now I ride the Benz, you ride the dick, with your punk friends,
straight up pussy from Punk City, my attitude's fucked up and real shitty.
From the backstabbers, yeah my so-called friends,
who swim in my pool. When it's time, flex the Benz,
around town, windows down at the South Town, Cool J tape or K-Solo ""Spellbound""
With fly girlies dippin, brothers grippin' and sippin'
Old Gold, Red Bull, hands on my dick and
I'm just lampin' with my EK shades, truck-jewels, obviously the man's paid.
But of course not, brother can't get his props
like for instance, when I cruise up the block
in my 560 lampin' on my Metro phone, chrome kit beamin' all off your dome.
But like a sucka, yeah, you looked the other way
That's how I knew you're on my dick kid, but it's okay.
It's normal, relax, your whole head's busted.
Caught in the rap skit, ya couldn't be trusted.
Cuz my sounds pound from here to Okinowi...{kiss} peace and I'm ouuuutie! 

Refrain 

Erick:
Stay tuned to this last episode, when I rock the house and the mic explodes.
This is not the buckwild style that I be usin', in fact black,
it causes {mass confusion}
It's a fallout, when sucker MCs and crowds call out my name,
oh what a shame I got {fame!}
Parrish:
I'm not a new jack, my rhymes are not wack, and in fact,
I'm like Clint Eastwood, 'stead of bullets, rhymes I pack
in my flow gun, so son, ya better run,
cuz when it comes to hostage and prisoners, we take none.
We move wax like kilos ...{scratch}
and when my jam hits the streets, the sounds explode.
Watch the right hook, duck the death blow jack,
I wonder where the E and the P's at...
(Can they do it again?) You bet your ass, black.
(See you in '91) Until things get the bozack... (I'm mad...)

Won't you tell me Molly darling
That you love none else but me
For I love you Molly darling
You are all the world to me.

Oh, tell darling, that you love me
Put your little hand in mine
Take my heart sweet Molly darling
Say that you will give me time.

--- Instrumental ---

Stars are smiling Molly darling
Through a misty veil of night
They seem laughing Molly darling
While the Moon hides her light.

Oh, no one listens but the flowers
While they hang their heads in shame
They are modest Molly darling
When they hear me call your name.

Molly there is sweetest dearest
Look up darling tell me this
Do you love me Molly darling
Let your answer be a kiss...",happy,1956

Yeah, y'all really want this to happen? (Game time!)
C'mon!

[The Game]
Homey it's hard not to kill niggas, it's like a full time job
Not to pull out the steel and shove it in your grill
Young California got that mass appeal
I summons the hood, they get up in yo' ass for real
Knockout flow, Winky Wright jab for real
And all you niggas pussy, need Massengil
See I'm the gun-cocker, one-shotter, lift 'em off the ground
Chop 'em down, like a cantaloupe, my flow the antidote
Sick flow, it's so, motherfuckin' six-four
Your bitch know, hop in the back when you see Swizz hoe
This that, all you niggas get up off my dick so
I can cook crack on the track and watch it mix slow
Cocaine, my flow fire, call it propane
Every nigga know Game, five shots no pain
And that's the reason why I'm shittin' on you niggas
Shut me in the looney bin, I'm sicker than you niggas

[Chorus: x2]
This is that disrespectful, motherfuckin' West coast
Hip-hop death blow, Swizz Beatz, let's go!

[The Game]
Where I'm from, I seen the most stand up niggaz lay down
Where skinny niggas make buff niggas victims of that trey-pound
And gang-bangers is the sharpshooters, we don't need no rooftops
Just knock his ass down and take the money out his tube socks
West coast niggas is back on the map
If only for now until the next time I body a track
From the first clap I hurt rap, now watch the earth crack
Bring the hearse back, and take a lyrical dirt nap
I roll with the hardest niggas, make money with the smartest niggas
I ain't got time for you fuckin' artist niggas
Better shut your trap before you become a target nigga
Y'all army brats I'm the motherfuckin' sergeant nigga
Beauty pageant-ass niggas on the runway
(Boyz N The Hood) till they see the nigga in that red Hyundai
Blow his fuckin' back out, cause I'm the rap Stack-house
Black Wall Street bitch, the hip-hop crack-house, what?

[Chorus: x2]

[The Game]
My flow opposite of handsome, it's ugly
Hip hop tantrum, sick, call the shit cancer
One man show cause I fucked all the dancers
Let the critics ask questions, my album be the answer
These niggas let the rumors sit in they head like tumors
So I had to take 'em back, to toothbrush on the Pumas
Clean, mean, rappin' machine
Red rag hangin low in the back of my jeans
I black out like February, back out what's necessary
Oh-seven Bugatti with Jimmy Iovine's secretary
I'm runnin' the buildin', don't make me run in the buildin'
No this ain't the first time I had my gun in the buildin'
Walkin' past offices I see my son in the buildin'
Last album on the wall I'm number one in the buildin'
They should build me an office up under the buildin'
My elevator goin' down, I am done in the buildin' nigga

[Chorus: x2]

[Swizz Beatz]
We in the motherfuckin' buildin' man
You ain't got your motherfuckin' mind right?
You gon' get your mind blown out your motherfuckin' mind right nigga
It is what the fuck it is man
How y'all wanna cut the cake?
You touch this you get your hands cut off, nigga
Swizz Beatz the motherfuckin' monster

We could turn this whole motherfuckin' world red nigga

Dinosaur Jr,Green Mind,"I picture things a certain way.  
Then go back to it another day. 
The green mind said it's okay...
Cause you know where they're gonna be. 
All's you have to do is come with me.  
It's cool, they're probably asleep. 

On the outside, 
that's where they always hide. 
Come to my side 
and I'll introduce you to... 
some of their kind.  
I know you've always tried.  
And now it's your time to take in their point of view, 
though it's nothing new.

I been bouncin' off the wall, 
I can't handle them for long.  
They're cool, but I need you... 
On a certain level I think they're great, 
but on another I can't relate... 
to anything they do.  

On the outside, 
might be with them tonight. 
Unless you decide to come n' I'll check out you.  
Hangin' heavy such a routine, 
I've just begun to forget 
why I seldom try to break out of their scene.  
And now I gotta work on you, 
so the frogs will hang and they'll always be hangin'...  
Now we're here, what do we do? 

I've been sortin' through the pros,
and cons of your eyes, farewell toads.  
Can't you help move it along? 
I been pickin' through my thoughts, 
it's a shame my judgement rots... 
and I sure feel rotten long...

On the outside... 
well, it'll be a while.  
I gotta unfry 'fore I pick it up with you.(Help me)  
Do I need that stable care? 
Don't I know that they'll be there? 
Does that count now you've appeared? 
Do I need that stable core? 
Or do I jump for something more? 
Are you all that I fear? 

I been pickin' through my thoughts, 
it's a shame my judgement rots... 
and I sure feel rotten long... 
It's a call that's tough to make.  
It could be a big mistake.  
Can't you help move it along? 
If I keep stewin' 'bout how I feel, 
eventually you'll split, 
then I won't have to deal.(Sounds like a plan) 
But it's kind of lame to let it slide,
knowin' either way I haven't tried. 
Can't figure out where it all stands...

Wednesday 13,Haunt Me (Album Version),"This Halloween I think that we should be together 
Just for old time's sake
I wanna hear you scream just like 
You used to when we were only thirteen

Now the candle's burning out
And the pumpkin's rotting away
I just want you here beside me
On this lonesome Halloween day

Sitting in the dark
Drinking my own blood
And a voice, it whispers, ""Hello my love""

Haunt me, haunt me like you used to
Won't you scare me, oh
Haunt me, haunt me like you used to
I love you best when you scare me to death

I'm laying in our bed with these
Tainted sheets pulled right over my head
I'm singing all our favorite songs out loud
And I'm hoping you can hear them somehow

Now the candle's burning out
And the pumpkin's rotting away
I just want you here beside me
On this lonesome Halloween day

Sitting in the dark
Drinking my own blood
And a voice, it whispers, ""Hello my love""

Haunt me, haunt me like you used to
Won't you scare me, oh
Haunt me, haunt me like you used to
I love you best when you scare me to death

Haunt me, haunt me like you used to
Won't you scare me, oh
Haunt me, haunt me like you used to
I love you best when you scare me to death

Every word you said, it ricochets
Just like a bullet in my head
I wish that you could see that our love 
Is bringing out the dead in me

Now the candle's burning out
And the pumpkin's rotting away
I just want you here beside me
On this lonesome Halloween day

Sitting in the dark
Drinking my own blood
And a voice, it whispers, ""Hello my love""

Won't you scare me, oh
Haunt me, haunt me like you used to

You've packed up the cups and dishes
Loaded down the car
Hold your horses just a minute
Before you get too far
Where you think you're goin' darlin'
Where you think you're goin' with my heart

You can have the 'frigerator and the new TV
Take the pictures off the wall
That's alright by me but
Where you think you're goin' sweet pea
Where you think you're goin' with my heart

Girl, we had a good thing goin'
Now you're gonna leave
But you've got somethin' that belongs to me
Look at me now, can't you see
It's tearin' me apart
Where you think you're goin' sugar puddin'
Where you think you're goin' with my heart

If that's what you want
Is for me to just break right down
I just might do it

Girl, we had a good thing goin'
But now you're gonna leave
But you've got somethin' that belongs to me
Look at me now, can't you see
It's tearin' me apart
Where you think you're goin' honey bunny
Where you think you're goin' with my heart

Where you think you're goin' sweet cheeks
Where you think you're goin' with my heart

Don't you want to kiss me

Smog nearly chocking me as the car horns go insane
Patiently waiting to get their old jobs backs
Carrying the human race proudly on their backs

How easily forgotten,
How easily we're led
How hard the path is trodden
From when horsepower meant what it said

I've got a hundred horses hidden in between my wheels
But i can't put my foot down and jumped the fences in the field
Patiently waiting to get their old jobs back

How easily forgotten,
How easily we're led
How hard the path is trodden
From when horsepower meant what it said

And if we're keeping up with progress why am i standing still
Maybe we should take a walk and talk to the horses on the hill

How easily forgotten,
How easily we're led
How hard the path is trodden
From when horsepower meant what it said

Learn to speak in tongues something

Stand on the old plateau
With a satellite dish and Geronimo's ghost

Down in the Rio Del Sol
I sunk my suitcase alone
Filed up the Amazon
With snakes and vines and ropes for my clothes

Walking through cactus and stones

Shining like razors in the sun

And try to find happiness from a gun",sad,2009

Feels as desperate as me
And what you give is what you get

It doesn't matter if we never meet again
What we have said will always remain
If we get through for two minutes only
It will be a start!
For knowing that someone in this life
Loves with a passion called hate
And what you give is what you get

If I never ever see you (if I never ever see you)

Origin purpose be partially profound of the very power that's in me

Jesus is my older brother evidently, experiment in me
Let the complexity collapse the pocket quickly

Yet I ponder why, I smoke my presence prominently?

And the roar of the crowd died down
They didn't hold their breath
They just waited to drown

Now, I'm the ghost in the corner
That nobody knows
I'm just a chill in the air that comes
And cuts you to the bone

I've never seen it shine so bright before
I stumble blind into the light of it all

The walls of this city are
All cold metal and stone
But we're nothing permanent:
We're just soft skin and bones

I'm just the pins and the
Needles attacking your toes
I'm just a message saved
In your phone a long, long time ago
Where I'm singing how...

I've never seen it shine so bright before
I stumbled blind into the light, the light of it all
You've never seen it shine, so hard before—
You'd crumble underneath the weight, the weight of it all

I'm always with you
I never left you alone",sad,2007

The women don't like her, they call her Ida Mae
But the way the men love her is a cryin' shame

I tell you people what she done
She made a hit with Jack the Ripper, and the only one

You women don't have to worry 'bout your life
She made Jack the Ripper throw away his knife

She shook it for the judge, and put the cop in jail

Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever)
The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme.
Forever ever? Forever ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?......

Close your eyes and imagine, feel the magic
Vegas on acid,
Seen through Yves St. Laurent glasses
And I've realized that I've arrived, cuz
It take more than a magazine to kill my Vibrate does
he write his own rhymes, so sort of
I think 'em
That mean I forgot better shit than you ever thought up
Damn, is he really that caught up?
I ask if you talkin' bout classics, do my name get brought up?
I remember I couldn't afford a Ford Escort or even a four-track recorder
so its only right that I let the top drop on a drop-top Porsche
- its for yourself that's important
If you're a stripper named Porscha and you get tips from many men
Then your fat friend her nickname is Minivan
Excuse me,
That's just the Henny, man, I smoke, I drink, I'm supposed to stop I can't because

I was sick about awards
Couldn't nobody cure me
Only playa that got robbed but kept all his jewelry
Alicia Keys tried to talk some sense to them
30 minutes later seems there's no convincing them
What more could you ask for?
The international asshole
Who complains about what he is owed?
And throw a tantrum like he is three years old
You gotta love it though somebody still speaks from his soul
And wouldn't change by the change, or the game, or the fame, 
When he came, in the game, he made his own lane
Now all I need is y'all to pronounce my name
Its Kanye - But some of my plaques - they still say Kane
Got family in the D, Kin-folk from Motown
Back in the Chi - them folks ain't from Motown
Life movin' too fast I need to slow down
Girl ain't give me no ass, ya need to go down

Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
My father Ben said I need Jesus
So he took me to church and let the water wash over my ceaser
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
The preacher said we need leaders
Right then my body got still like a paraplegic

You know who you can call you gotta best believe it
The Roc stand tall and you would never believe it
Take your diamonds and throw 'em up like you bulimic
Yea the beat cold but the flow is anemic
After debris settles and the dust get swept off
Big K pick up where young Hov left off
Right when magazines wrote Kanye West off
I dropped my new shit, it sound like the best of
A&R's lookin' like ""Pssh we messed up""
Grammy night, damn right, we got dressed up
Bottle after bottle 'till we got messed up
In the studio, where really though, yea he next up
People askin' me if I'm gon' give my chain back
That'll be the same day I give the game back
You know the next question dog ""Yo, where Dame at?""
This track the Indian dance to bring our reign back
""What's up with you and Jay, man, are y'all ok man?""
They pray for the death of our dynasty like Amen
R-r-r-right here stands a-man
With the power to make a diamond with his bare hands...

The Killers,A Dustland Fairytale,"A dustland fairytale beginning
Or just another white trash county kiss
In '61, long brown hair and foolish eyes

He looked just like you'd want him to
Some kind of slick chrome American prince
A blue jean serenade
And moon river what'd you do to me?
I don't believe you

Saw Cinderella in a party dress
But she was lookin' for a nightgown
I saw the devil wrappin' up his hands
He's getting ready for the showdown
I saw the minute that I turned away
I got my money on a pawn tonight

A change came in disguise
Of revelation, set his soul on fire
She says she always knew he'd come around

And the decades disappear like sinking ships
But we persevere, God gives us hope
But we still fear what we don't know
Your mind is poisoned

Castles in the sky sit stranded, vandalized
A drawbridge is closin'

Saw Cinderella in a party dress
But she was lookin' for a nightgown
I saw the devil wrappin' up his hands
He's getting ready for the showdown
I saw the ending when they turned the page
I threw my money and I ran away
Straight to the valley of the great divide

Out where the dreams are high
Out where the wind don't blow
Out here the good girls die
And the sky won't snow

Out here the bird don't sing
Out here the field don't grow
Out here the bell don't ring
Out here the bell don't ring

Out here the good girls die

Now Cinderella don't you go to sleep
It's such a bitter form of refuge
Oh don't you know the kingdom's under siege
And everybody needs you?

Is there still magic in the midnight sun
Or did you leave it back in '61?
In the cadence of a young man's eyes
Out where the dreams are high",sad,2008

The message from the angel come to life

Why me, I'm just a simple man of trade
Why Him with all the rulers in the world
Why here inside this stable filled with hay
Why her, she's just an ordinary girl
Now I'm not one to second guess
What angels have to say
But this is such a strange way to save the
World

To think of how it could have been
If Jesus had come as He deserved
There would have been no Bethlehem
No lowly shepherds at His birth

But Joseph knew the
Reason love had to reach so far
And as he held the Savior in his arms
He must have thought

Made a promise for a new life
Made a victim out of your life

When your time's on the door
And it drips to the floor
And you feel you can touch
All the noise is too much
And the seeds that are sown
Are no longer your own

Just a minor operation
To force a final ultimatum
Thousand words are spoken loud
Reach the dumb to fool the crowd

When you walk down the street
And the sound's not so sweet
And you wish you could hide
Maybe go for a ride
To some peep show arcade
Where the future's not made

A nightmare situation
Infiltrate imagination
Smacks of past Holy wars
By the wall with broken laws

The leaders of men
Born out of your frustration
The leaders of men
Just a strange infatuation
The leaders of men
Made a promise for a new life

Self induced manipulation
To crush all thoughts of mass salvation",sad,1978

Leave her with a baby sitter, mama, call the grave digger
Gone with the fallen leaves
Am I coming out of left field?
Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now
I been feeling it since 1966, now
Might've had your fill, but you feel it still
Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now
Let me kick it like it's 1986, now
Might be over now, but I feel it still
We could fight a war for peace
(Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now)
Give in to that easy living
Goodbye to my hopes and dreams
Stop flipping for my enemies
We could wait until the walls come down
(Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now)
It's time to give a little to the
Kids in the middle, but oh 'til it falls
Won't bother me
Is it coming?
Is it coming?
Is it coming?
Is it coming?
Is it coming?
Is it coming back?
Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, yeah
Your love is an abyss for my heart to eclipse, now
Might be over now, but I feel it still
Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now
I've been feeling it since 1966, now
Might be over now, but I feel it still
Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now
Let me kick it like it's 1986, now
Might be over now, but I feel it still
Might've had your fill, but you feel it still",happy,2017

Alma,Chasing Highs,"Two a.m., I'm fading in the dark
Like floating in the ocean
People need the poison
Three a.m., you just touched my hand
And made me lose my focus
I almost didn't notice
And I better know what to do
Who's gonna be the first one to move?
I wanna get closer to you
And I better know what to do
Who's gonna be the first one to move?
I wanna get closer to you
I was chasing highs
Then I found you
We're doing it in slow motion
We're doing it in slow motion
I was chasing highs
Then I found you
You are getting closer in slow motion
I'm chasing hi-hi-hi-highs
I'm chasing hi-hi-hi-hi-highs
I'm chasing hi-hi-hi-highs
You are getting closer in slow motion
Four a.m., almost touching you
Drowning out the noises
In between the voices
Five a.m., there is something more
I caught the luck you gave me
Phases groing hazy
And I better know what to do
Who's gonna be the first one to move?
I wanna get closer to you
And I better know what to do

Macklemore ,Glorious,"You know I'm back like I never left (I never left)
Another sprint, another step (another step)
Another day, another breath (another breath)
Been chasing dreams, but I never slept (I never slept)
I got a new attitude and a lease on life
And some peace of mind
Seek and I find I can sleep when I die
Wanna piece of the pie, grab the keys to the ride
And shit I'm straight
I'm on my wave, I'm on my wave
Get out my wake, I'm running late, what can I say?
I heard you die twice, once when they bury you in the grave
And the second time is the last time that somebody mentions your name
So when I leave here on this earth, did I take more than I gave?
Did I look out for the people or did I do it all for fame?
Legend, it's exodus searching for euphoria
Trudging through the mud to find the present, no ignoring us
Got 20, 000 deep off in the street like we some warriors
My mama told me never bow your head, woo!
I feel glorious, glorious
Got a chance to start again
I was born for this, born for this
It's who I am, how could I forget?
I made it through the darkest part of the night
And now I see the sunrise
Now I feel glorious, glorious
I feel glorious, glorious
I'm feeling glorious
The crib looking Victorian (oh yes it is)
You know that we been going in (been going in)
Since we hopped out that Delorean (Delorean, yeah we win)
En garde, things are just things
They don't make you who you are
Can't pack up a U-Haul and take it with you when you're gone
We posted on the porch, my family's glasses to the stars
My grandma smiling down on me like woo, that boy got bars
Okay, okay, yes I do
I said amen and hallelujah, let me testify too
Another morning, a morning, don't let self get in my way
I got my breath, I got my faith and I remember why I came
I feel glorious, glorious
Got a chance to start again
I was born for this, born for this
It's who I am, how could I forget?
I made it through the darkest part of the night
And now I see the sunrise
Now I feel glorious, glorious
I feel glorious, glorious
We gon' be alright, put that on my life
When I open my eyes, hope I see you shine
We're planting a flag they don't understand
The world is up for grabs (Hey, hey, hey)
We gon' be alright, put that on my life
When I open my eyes, hope I see you shine
We're planting a flag they don't understand

Need you to give me a sign

Rita Ora,Anywhere,"Time flies by when the night is young
Daylight shines on an unexposed location, location
Bloodshot eyes lookin' for the sun
Paradise we live it, and we call it a vacation, vacation
You're painting me a dream that I
Wouldn't belong in, wouldn't belong in
Over the hills and far away
A million miles from L.A
Just anywhere away with you
I know we've got to get away
Someplace where no one knows our name
We'll find the start of something new
Just take me anywhere, take me anywhere
Anywhere away with you
Just take me anywhere, take me anywhere
Anywhere away with you
Fun, little less fun
Little less, over, over, over, over, me
Oh, fun, little less fun
Little less, over, over, over, over, me
Truth comes out when we're blacking out
Looking for connection in a crowd of empty faces, empty faces
Your secrets are the only thing I'm craving now
The good, and the bad, and the end
'Cause I can take it, I can take it
You're painting me a dream that I
Wouldn't belong in, wouldn't belong in
Over the hills and far away
A million miles from L.A
Just anywhere away with you
I know we've got to get away
Someplace where no one knows our name
We'll find the start of something new
Just take me anywhere, take me anywhere
Anywhere away with you
Fun, little less fun
Little less, over, over, over, over, me
Oh, fun, little less fun

Jess Glynne,Don't Be So Hard on Yourself,"I came here with a broken heart that no one else could see
I drew a smile on my face to paper over me
The wounds heal and tears dry and cracks they don't show
So don't be so hard on yourself, no
Let's go back to simplicity
I feel like I've been missing me
Was not who I'm supposed to be
I felt this darkness over me
We all get there eventually
I never knew where I belonged
But I was right and you were wrong
Been telling myself all along
Don't be so hard on yourself, no
Learn to forgive, learn to let go
Everyone trips, everyone falls
So don't be so hard on yourself, no
'Cause I'm just tired of marching on my own
Kind of frail, I feel it in my bones
Oh let my heart, my heart turn into stone
So don't be so hard on yourself, no
I'm standin' on top of the world, right where I wanna be
So how can this dark cloud keep raining over me
But hearts break and hells a place that everyone knows
So don't be so hard on yourself, no
Let's go back to simplicity
I feel like I've been missing me
Was not who I'm supposed to be
I felt this darkness over me
We all get there eventually

Kind of frail, I feel it in my bones
Oh let my heart, my heart turn into stone
So don't be so hard on yourself, no
Oh, oh, oh, I
I learned to wave goodbye
How not to see my life
Through someone else's eyes
It's not an easy road
But now I'm not alone
So I, I won't be so hard on myself no more
Don't be so hard on yourself, no
Learn to forgive, learn to let go
Everyone trips, everyone falls
So don't be so hard on yourself, no

Kind of frail, I feel it in my bones
Oh let my heart, my heart turn into stone

I've been waitin' such a long, long, long time to feel it
Swallowed by the waters around me
No I took so many wrong, wrong, wrong turns to see it, woah

And I laughed 'til I cried and cried and
I ran 'til my feet couldn't run no more (no more, no more)
And I sung 'til my lungs were burnin'
'Til I know I'm alive, alive, yeah

And I don't miss you anymore
When the sun comes up

I had to sleep through such a cold, cold, cold night to see it
Green flashes hid me right where I'm standing
Sunlight got into the bone, bone, bone, start the healing

But I danced through the blisters at night
And I laughed 'til I cried and cried and
I ran 'til my feet couldn't run no more (no more, no more)

But I can taste you on the tip of my tongue
Alarm without no warning
You're by my side and we've got smoke in our lungs
Last night we were way up, kissing in the back of the cab
And then you say, ""Love, baby, let's go back to my flat""
And when we wake up, never had a feeling like that
I got a reason, so man, put that record on again
I don't want to hear sad songs anymore
I only want to hear love songs
I found my heart up in this place tonight
Don't want to sing mad songs anymore
Only want to sing your song
'Cause your song's got me feeling like I'm
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love
Yeah, you know, your song's got me feeling like I'm
No fear but I think I'm falling
I'm not proud
But I'm usually the type of girl that would hit and run
No risk so I think I'm all in
When I kiss your lips, feel my heartbeat thump
And now we're way up, dancing on the roof of the house
And then we make love, right there on your best friend's couch
And then you say, ""Love, this is what it's all about""
So keep on kissing my mouth and put that record on again
I don't want to hear sad songs anymore
I only want to hear love songs
I found my heart up in this place tonight
Don't want to sing mad songs anymore

Waiting for the time to pass you by
Hope the winds of change will change your mind
I could give a thousand reasons why
And I know you, and you've got to

Make it on your own, but we don't have to grow up
We can stay forever young
Living on my sofa, drinking rum and cola
Underneath the rising sun
I could give a thousand reasons why
But you're going, and you know that

All you have to do is stay a minute
Just take your time
The clock is ticking, so stay
All you have to do is wait a second
Your hands on mine
The clock is ticking, so stay

[Post-Chorus]
All you have to do is
All you have to do is stay

Won't admit what I already know
I've never been the best at letting go
I don't wanna spend the night alone
Guess I need you, and I need to

We can stay forever young

We were sipping whiskey neat
Highest floor, The Bowery
Nowhere's high enough
Somewhere along the lines
We stopped seeing eye to eye
You were staying out all night
And I had enough
No, I don't wanna know
Where you been or where you're goin'
But I know I won't be home
And you'll be on your own
Who's gonna walk you through the dark side of the morning?
Who's gonna rock you when the sun won't let you sleep?
Who's waking up to drive you home when you're drunk and all alone?
Who's gonna walk you through the dark side of the morning?

We were back to seventeen
Summer nights and The Libertines
Never growing up
I'll take with me
The Polaroids and the memories
But you know I'm gonna leave
Behind the worst of us
Who's gonna walk you through the dark side of the morning?
Who's gonna rock you when the sun won't let you sleep?
Who's waking up to drive you home when you're drunk and all alone?

Get on up, baby, dance to the rhythm of the music
Don't care what the DJ chooses
Get lost in the rhythm of me
Place don't close until we wanna leave it

And dance like they do in the Mediterranean
Spin you around me again and again, and
You're like something that God has sent me
I want you, baby, solamente

Probably shoulda washed this, smells like R. Kelly's sheets

How to be brave
How can I love when I'm afraid to fall
But watching you stand alone
All of my doubt, suddenly goes away somehow
One step closer
I have died everyday, waiting for you
Darling, don't be afraid, I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more
Time stands still
Beauty in all she is
I will be brave
I will not let anything, take away
What's standing in front of me
Every breath, every hour has come to this
One step closer
I have died everyday, waiting for you
Darling, don't be afraid, I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more

Time has brought your heart to me, I have loved you for a thousand years

And landed on my feet

Out of the lion's den
I don't have to pretend
And it's too late
The story's over now, the end

"Roberta Flack, Peabo Bryson",Tonight I Celebrate My Love,"Tonight I celebrate my love for you
It seems the natural thing to do
Tonight no one's gonna find us
We'll leave the world behind us
When I make love to you
Tonight I celebrate my love for you
And hope that deep inside you'll feel it, too
Tonight our spirits will be climbing
To a sky filled up with diamonds
When I make love to you, tonight
Tonight I celebrate my love for you
And that midnight sun is gonna come shining through
Tonight there'll be no distance between us
What I want most to do, is to get close to you
Tonight
Tonight I celebrate my love for you
And soon this old world will seem brand new
Tonight we will both discover how friends turn into lovers
When I make love to you
Tonight I celebrate my love for you

Tonight there'll be no distance between us
What I want most to do, is to get close to you

That some things are meant to be
And that you'll make a better me
Everyday I love you
I never thought that dreams came true
But you showed me that they do
You know that I learn something new
Everyday I love you
'Cause I believe that destiny
Is out of our control (don't you know that I do)
And you'll never live until you love
With all your heart and soul
It's a touch when I feel bad
It's a smile when I get mad
All the little things I am
Everyday I love you
Everyday I love you boy

'Cause I believe that destiny
Is out of our control (don't you know that I do)

Have I told you there's no one else above you?
Fill my heart with gladness, take away all my sadness
Ease my troubles, that's what you do
For the morning sun in all it's glory
Meets the day with hope and comfort too
You fill my life with laughter, somehow you make it better
Ease my troubles, that's what you do
There's a love less defined
And its yours and its mine

And at the end of the day
We should give thanks and pray

We start a fire
Sparklers in every hand
No phones let go
Cut all the strings tonight
Singin' aloud
Howlin' right at the moon
We're making out

And your jeans soaked through

We don't need gravity here in the afterglow
Back of the car
Blankets and me and you
We're running on perfectly wasted youth
I'll hold you close
We'll call this home tonight

Had an X and an O
Never change who you are

Kid Rock,All Summer Long,"It was 1989, my thoughts were short my hair was long
Caught somewhere between a boy and man
She was seventeen and she was far from in-between
It was summertime in Northern Michigan
Ahh Ahh Ahh
Ahh Ahh Ahh
Splashing through the sand bar
Talking by the campfire
It's the simple things in life, like when and where
We didn't have no internet
But man I never will forget
The way the moonlight shined upon her hair
And we were trying different things
We were smoking funny things
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song
Sipping whiskey out the bottle, not thinking 'bout tomorrow
Singing Sweet home Alabama all summer long
Singing Sweet home Alabama all summer long
Catching Walleye from the dock
Watching the waves roll off the rocks
She'll forever hold a spot inside my soul
We'd blister in the sun
We couldn't wait for night to come
To hit that sand and play some rock and roll
While we were trying different things
And we were smoking funny things
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song
Sipping whiskey out the bottle, not thinking 'bout tomorrow
Singing Sweet Home Alabama all summer long
Singing Sweet Home Alabama all summer long
Now nothing seems as strange as when the leaves began to change
Or how we thought those days would never end
Sometimes I'll hear that song and I'll start to sing along
And think man I'd love to see that girl again
And we were trying different things
We were smoking funny things
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song
Sipping whiskey out the bottle, not thinking 'bout tomorrow
Singing Sweet home Alabama all summer long
Singing Sweet home Alabama all summer long
And we were trying different things
We were smoking funny things
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song
Sipping whiskey out the bottle, not thinking 'bout tomorrow

Jake Miller,A Million Lives,"Wow
Wow, yeah
The other day I got an email, I almost didn't read it
But something caught my eye right before I could delete it
It was bold and underlined, ""Please Read"" was the title
Followed by ""Jake you are my idol""
It said and I quote, my name is Nikki and I used to be dancer
Til the day the doctor diagnosed me with cancer
So I said goodbye to all the hair on my head
And hello to my hospital bed
Yeah see I was just a normal girl, it happened so fast
There were so many days that I thought would be my last
However the fight was tough, and the battle was long
But I felt strong when I listened to your songs
You were, always there for me, you helped my heart beat
You were my only friend, kept you on repeat
I thanks God for you every single night
'Cause believe or not, you saved my life
I've met a million people, been a million places
Shook a million hands, seen a million faces
I've had a million lows, and a million more highs
No I haven't made a million, but I've touched a million lives
I've met a million people, been a million places
Shook a million hands, seen a million faces
I've had a million lows, and a million more highs
No I haven't made a million, but I've touched a million lives
Yeah the mailman knocked said it was for me
Handed me a box, sent from Tennessee
Written on the top ""for jakes eyes only""
Inside was a journal and letter that he wrote me
It said my name is Dillon I'm in 7th grade
I'm ridiculed and picked on almost everyday
Yeah they push me in the halls in between my classes
Yesterday they took my books then broke my glasses
I got no one to talk to, its like I don't exist
Sometimes I wonder if I was gone, would I be missed?
But lemme tell you the real reason for this letter
You've helped me through it all, you've help me feel better
Your words gimme confidence, your messages inspire me
You help me find my inner strength deep inside of me
Through all the bad times, you helped me find the light
Believe or not, you saved my life
I've met a million people, been a million places
Shook a million hands, seen a million faces
I've had a million lows, and a million more highs
No I haven't made a million, but I've touched a million lives

Shook a million hands, seen a million faces
I've had a million lows, and a million more highs
No I haven't made a million, but I've touched a million lives
I was sittin' at my table at dinner the other night
When I noticed a little girl sittin' to my right
She was lookin' at me like she knew me, I guess she did
'Cause then she walked right up to, and then she said
My name is Sami and I swear that I'm your biggest fan
I think she even had my name written on her hand
She said me and my brother used to listen to you every day
Until last year, when he passed away
I'll never forget seein' my parents cry
When they got a call sayin' that your son had died
Man I wish that he was here now, you were his favourite
He had your mixtape and never stopped playin' it
Your music gives me a feelin that I just can't describe
It's like I got my brother back, and he's still alive
I pray for both of you, every single night
'Cause believe or not, you saved my life
I've met a million people, been a million places
Shook a million hands, seen a million faces
I've had a million lows, and a million more highs
No I haven't made a million, but I've touched a million lives
I've met a million people, been a million places
Shook a million hands, seen a million faces
I've had a million lows, and a million more highs
No I haven't made a million, but I've touched a million lives
Now let me turn the table, and talk to you
I had a dream but you're the reason that its comin' true
Yeah I've had some dark days, when the sun don't shine
But you always reminded me that I would be fine
'Cause when no else cared, you believed in my vision
And now I got an army comin' with me on my mission
I thank God for all you, every single night
Cause believe or not, you saved my life",happy,2013

Wanna lose sense of space and time

Maddie & Tae ,Girl in a Country Song,"Well, I wish I had some shoes
On my two bare feet
And it's getting kinda cold
In these painted on cut-off jeans
I hate the way this bikini top chafes
Do I really have to wear it all day
Yeah, baby
I hear you over there
On your tailgate whistlin'
Sayin', ""Hey, Girl""
But you know I ain't listenin'
'Cause I got a name
And to you, it ain't ""pretty little thing"",
""Honey"", or ""baby""
It's driving me red-red-red-red-red-red-redneck crazy
Being the girl in a country song
How in the world did it go so wrong
Like all I'm good for is lookin' good for
You and your friends on the weekend, nothin' more
We used to get a little respect
Now we're lucky if we even get
To climb up in your truck
Keep our mouths shut, and ride along
And be the girl in a country song
Well, shakin' my moneymaker
Ain't never made me a dime
And there ain't no sugar for you
In this shaker of mine
Tell me one more time
You gotta get you some of that
Sure, I'll slide on over
But you're gonna get slapped
Ha, these days, it ain't easy bein' that
Girl in a country song
How in the world did it go so wrong
Like all I'm good for is lookin' good for
You and your friends on the weekend, nothin' more
We used to get a little respect
Now we're lucky if we even get
To climb up in your truck
Keep our mouths shut, and ride along
And be the girl in a country song
Yep, yep, yeah, baby
Aw, naw, Conway and George Strait
Never did it this way
Back in the old days
All y'all, we ain't a cliché
That ain't no way
To treat a lady
Like a girl in a country song
How in the world did it go so wrong
Like all I'm good for is lookin' good for
You and your friends on the weekend, nothin' more
Whoa! We used to get a little respect
Now we're lucky if we even get
To climb up in your truck
Keep our mouths shut, and ride along
Down some old dirt road we don't even want to be on
And be the girl in a country song
I ain't your tan-legged Juliet!
Can I put on some real clothes now?
Aw, naw

Come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me

We're going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like

Bryan Adams,Summer of ??9,"I got my first real six-string
Bought it at the five-and-dime
Played it 'til my fingers bled
Was the summer of sixty-nine
Me and some guys from school
Had a band and we tried real hard
Jimmy quit, Jody got married
I should've known we'd never get far
Oh, when I look back now
That summer seemed to last forever
And if I had the choice
Yeah, I'd always wanna be there
Those were the best days of my life
Ain't no use in complainin'
When you've got a job to do
Spent my evenings down at the drive-in
And that's when I met you, yeah
Standin' on your mama's porch
You told me that you'd wait forever
Oh, and when you held my hand
I knew that it was now or never
Those were the best days of my life
Oh, yeah
Back in the summer of sixty-nine, oh
Man, we were killin' time, we were young and restless
We needed to unwind
I guess nothin' can last forever, forever, no
Yeah
And now the times are changin'
Look at everything that's come and gone
Sometimes when I play that old six-string
I think about you, wonder what went wrong
Standin' on your mama's porch
You told me that it'd last forever
Oh, and when you held my hand
I knew that it was now or never
Those were the best days of my life

Maybe there?�s a way out of the cage where you live
Maybe one of these days you can let the light in
Show me how big your brave is
Say what you wanna say
And let the words fall out
Honestly I wanna see you be brave
With what you want to say
And let the words fall out
Honestly I wanna see you be brave
Innocence, your history of silence
Won?�t do you any good
Did you think it would?
Let your words be anything but empty
Why don?�t you tell them the truth?
Say what you wanna say
And let the words fall out
Honestly I wanna see you be brave
With what you want to say
And let the words fall out
Honestly I wanna see you be brave

Hot Natured,Reverse Skydiving,"[Verse 1]
Flying, climbing
This is what I feel when I'm reverse skydiving
Neptune, shining
Frying all the elements as they're combining
Rewind, timing
This be the contract for sky I'll be signing
No concern for wining or dining
Wind so blue that it might be blinding
All that I know is I won't be minding

You don't have to jump to fly with me
You don't have to jump to fly with me
You don't have to jump to fly with me

Flying, climbing
Giving me a smile, that's the inverse of crying
Upwards, mining
My dress seems like a ruby and the stars be aligning
Sky that's shining
Angles that I'm turning on continue refining
No concern for eyes that are prying
Spell my name with lighting and keep rewinding
All that I know is I won't be minding

You don't have to jump to fly with me
You don't have to jump to fly with me

Twirl your dresses around
Lift your cotton socks on
And turn your cameras on now for the fun

Look out that your soles don't burn to the floor

Once again, I find myself with my friends
Dancing the night away, it's like the party never ends
Then again we don't want it to stop, coz tonight's the night it goes sweat box
Laser beams, flashing lights, wild cards, men from Mars, dressed in Stars and stripes
Eclectic, electric, ladies of the evening, drinking booze and mingling
Mashing to the music, I can do anything
Freaky Dicky star speckles and pink butterflies and life is nice, so nice
I walk into a club and I've found paradise, I'm seeing stars, I can't believe my eyes
Oh my starry eyed surprise, sundown to sunrise
I dance all night, we're gonna dance all night, dance all night to this DJ
Ah Sugar, dance all night to this DJ

Dance all night, we're gonna dance all night, dance all night to this DJ
Ah Sugar, dance all night to this DJ, dance all night to this DJ
Lover dance all night to this DJ
Like the record spins on the trails we blaze, the walls are closing in but that's okay
Because I've been waiting all week to feel this way and it feels so good, so good
I'm on top of the world the coolest kid in the neighborhood
So let me be your star for one night that's right
Sweat box, laser beams, flashing lights, you've got to feel the rush
Feel the spice of life, love life, Shifty rolls the dice snake eyes surprise
Icing, mesmerizing, the minds are sick ones, cause what we are is victims of fun
Come on, come on, the fun is just begun; come on the fun is just begun
Oh my starry eyed surprise, sundown to sunrise
I dance all night, we're gonna dance all night, dance all night to this DJ

You won't get undercounted 'cause you're damned and free

Baby you're the one that I need
You're the only one I see
Baby baby it's you
You're the one that gives your all
You're the one that always calls
When I need you everything stops
Finally you put my love

(Uh-huh, uh-huh)
And if I?�m a hot shot, mom will cut my hair at night
(Uh-huh, uh-huh)

Bleachers,I Wanna Get Better,"Hey, I hear the voice of a preacher from the back room
Calling my name and I follow just to find you
I trace the faith to a broken down television and put on the weather
And I've trained myself to give up on the past 'cause
I frozen time between hearses and caskets
Lost control when I panicked at the acid test
I wanna get better
While my friends were getting high and chasing girls down parkway lines
I was losing my mind 'cause the love, the love, the love, the love, the love
That I gave wasted on a nice face
In a blaze of fear I put a helmet on a helmet
Counting seconds through the night and got carried away
So now I'm standing on the overpass screaming at the cars,
Hey, I wanna get better!
I didn?�t know I was lonely 'til I saw your face
I wanna get better, better, better, better,
I wanna get better
I didn't know I was broken 'til I wanted to change
I wanna get better, better, better, better,
I wanna get better
I go up to my room and there's girls on the ceiling
Cut out their pictures and I chase that feeling
Of an eighteen year old who didn't know what loss was
Now I'm a stranger
And I miss the days of a life still permanent
Mourn the years before I got carried away
So now I'm staring at the interstate screaming at myself,
Hey, I wanna get better!
I didn't know I was lonely 'til I saw your face
I wanna get better, better, better, better,
I wanna get better
I didn't know I was broken 'til I wanted to change
I wanna get better, better, better, better,
I wanna get better
Better, 'cause I'm sleeping in the back of a taxi
I'm screaming from my bedroom window
Even if its gonna kill me
Woke up this morning early before my family
From this dream where she was trying to show me
How a life can move from the darkness
She said to get better
So I put a bullet where I shoulda put a helmet
And I crash my car 'cause I wanna get carried away
That's why I'm standing on the overpass screaming at myself
Hey, I wanna get better!
I didn't know I was lonely 'til I saw your face
I wanna get better, better, better, better,
I wanna get better
I didn't know I was broken 'til I wanted to change
I wanna get better, better, better, better,
I wanna get better

Uncle Kracker,Smile,"You're better than the best
I'm lucky just to linger in your light
Cooler then the flip side of my pillow, that's right
Completely unaware
Nothing can compare to where you send me,
Lets me know that it's OK, yeah it's OK
And the moments where my good times start to fade
You make me smile like the sun
Fall out of bed, sing like a bird
Dizzy in my head, spin like a record
Crazy on a Sunday night
You make me dance like a fool
Forget how to breathe
Shine like gold, buzz like a bee
Just the thought of you can drive me wild
Oh, you make me smile
Even when you're gone
Somehow you come along
Just like a flower poking through the sidewalk crack and just like that
You steal away the rain and just like that
You make me smile like the sun
Fall out of bed, sing like a bird
Dizzy in my head, spin like a record
Crazy on a Sunday night
You make me dance like a fool
Forget how to breathe
Shine like gold, buzz like a bee
Just the thought of you can drive me wild
Oh, you make me smile
Don't know how I lived without you
Cause every time that I get around ya
I see the best of me inside your eyes
You make me smile
You make me dance like a fool
Forget how to breathe

I see you separate from the others.
Bent crooked in the light around you
Bathing�?in the sight of the others.
I couldn't say what I was thinking my
Heart shrinking, two sad sparks blinking in the sun
Wait one minute I
Had to listen for it
It was hidden in the fall
Hidden in the fall
Waiting on love to call
Hidden in the fall
I met you in the dead of winter
I stood stranded in the water
Dug deeper than a crooked splinter
I turned away from all the others
I couldn't say what I was thinking my
Heart shrinking, two sad sparks blinking in the sun
Wait one minute I
Had to listen for it
It was hidden in the fall
Hidden in the fall
Waiting on love to call
Hidden in the fall
Sad hopes I'd hidden under
Tangled inside of me
You spoke like broken thunder
Deep�?into the center of me.

Heart shrinking, two sad sparks blinking in the sun

Had to listen for it

I hear it all in the center of my heart

Threw our shoes into the ocean
Sit back and wave through the daylight
Sit back and wave through the daylight

Slip and slide on subway grates
These shoes are poor mans ice skates
Fall through like change in the daylight

I miss yellow lines in my roads
Some color on monochrome

Maybe i?�ll paint them in myself
Maybe i?�ll paint them in myself
Maybe i?�ll paint them in myself
Maybe i?�ll paint them in myself

Building walls and an old pay phone

It rings like all through the daylight

And in the daylight we can hitchhike to maine
I hope that someday i?�ll see without these frames
And in the daylight I don?�t pick up my phone
'Cause in the daylight anywhere feels like home

I have five clocks in my life
And only one has the time right
I?�ll just unplug it for today
Ill just unplug it for today

Open hydrant rolled down windows
This car might make a good old boat
And float down grand street in daylight
And float down grand street in daylight
And float down grand street in daylight
And float down grand street in daylight
And float down grand street in daylight
And float down grand street in daylight

And with just half of a sunburn
New yellow lines that I earned
Step back and here comes the night time
Step back and here comes the night time

You know I got this far, I had a broken heart
No one hears silent tears collecting
'Cause it's being weak that's strong
In the truth I found
I have courage now, I'm gonna shout it out
Teacher, I feel the dots connecting

Beat down on me, beat down like a waterfall
'Cause I can take on so much more than I had ever dreamed
So beat down on me, beat down like a waterfall
'Cause baby, I am ready to be free

Now I am invincible
No, I ain't a scared little girl no more
Yeah, I am invincible
What was I running for
I was hiding from the world
I was so afraid, I felt so unsure
Now I am invincible
Another perfect storm

I was running from an empty threat
Of emptiness
I was running from an empty threat
That didn't exist
I was running from an empty threat
Of abandonment
I was running from an empty threat
That didn't exist

But now I am invincible
No, I ain't a scared little girl no more
Yeah, I am invincible
What was I running for
I was hiding from the world
I was so afraid, I felt so unsure
Now I am invincible 
Another perfect storm

Now I am invincible
No, I ain't a scared little girl no more
Yeah, I am invincible
What was I running for
I was hiding from the world
I was so afraid, I felt so unsure

Sia,Elastic Heart,"And another one bites the dust
But why can I not conquer love?
And I might've got to be with one
Why not fight this war without weapons?
And I want it and I wanted it bad
But there were so many red flags
Now another one bites the dust
And let's be clear, I trust no one
You did not break me
I'm still fighting for peace
Well I've got thick skin and an elastic heart
But your blade it might be too sharp
I'm like a rubber band until you pull too hard
But I may snap when I move close
But you won't see me fall apart
'Cause I've got an elastic heart
I've got an elastic heart
Yeah, I've got an elastic heart
And I will stay up through the night
Let's be clear, I won't close my eyes
And I know that I can survive
I walked through fire to save my life
And I want it, I want my life so bad
And I'm doing everything I can
Then another one bites the dust
It's hard to lose a chosen one
You did not break me (You did not break me, no, no)
I'm still fighting for peace
Well I've got thick skin and an elastic heart
But your blade it might be too sharp
I'm like a rubber band until you pull too hard
But I may snap when I move close

Florence + the Machine,Shake It Out,"Regrets collect like old friends
Here to relive your darkest moments
I can see no way, I can see no way
And all of the ghouls come out to play
And every demon wants his pound of flesh
But I like to keep some things to myself
I like to keep my issues strong
It's always darkest before the dawn
And I've been a fool and I've been blind
I can never leave the past behind
I can see no way, I can see no way
I'm always dragging that horse around
Our love is pastured such a mournful sound
Tonight I'm gonna bury that horse in the ground
So I like to keep my issues strong
But it's always darkest before the dawn
Shake it out, shake it out,
Shake it out, shake it out, ooh whoa
Shake it out, shake it out,
Shake it out, shake it out, ooh whoa
And it's hard to dance with a devil on your back
So shake him off, oh whoa
'Cause I am done with my graceless heart
So tonight I'm gonna cut it out and then restart
'Cause I like to keep my issues strong
It's always darkest before the dawn
Shake it out, shake it out
Shake it out, shake it out, ooh whoa
Shake it out, shake it out
Shake it out, shake it out, ooh whoa
And it's hard to dance with a devil on your back
So shake him off, oh whoa
I tried to dance with the devil on your back
And given half the chance would I take any of it back
It's a final mess but it's left me so empty
It's always darkest before the dawn
(Oh whoa, oh whoa)
And I'm damned if I do and I'm damned if I don't
So here's to drinks in the dark at the end of my road
And I'm ready to suffer and I'm ready to hope
It's a shot in the dark and right at my throat
'Cause looking for heaven, found the devil in me
Looking for heaven, for the devil in me
Well what the hell I'm gonna let it happen to me
Shake it out, shake it out,
Shake it out, shake it out, ooh whoa
Shake it out, shake it out,
Shake it out, shake it out, ooh whoa
And it's hard to dance with a devil on your back
So shake him off, oh whoa

Blame it on that Conjure

Neck Deep,Gold Steps,"I've been stuck in the middle pages,
Hung up on a cross that I created,
Built out of the bones that I've been breaking.
The sign you said you needed
Is there but you can't see it.
You might be down and out but you're still breathing.

If you write the story, then you'll find out we're all stuck on the same page.

'Cause sometimes things will bend you,
But trust me you'll be fine
'Cause I've been moving mountains that I once had to climb.
And life's not out to get you,
Despite the things you've been through,
Because what you give is what you get,
And it doesn't make sense to make do.

The walls are caving in again,
Happens every now and then,
Always got me feeling like I'm fucked.
Falling in and out of bed,
Sleep so I feel like I'm dead,
Trying to get a grip is kinda rough.

You say life has lost its meaning,
And that's true if you believe it,
But someday you will stand above your demons,
You're not beneath this.

If you write the story, then you'll find out we're all stuck on the same page.

'Cause sometimes things will bend you,
But trust me you'll be fine,
'Cause I've been moving mountains that I once had to climb.
And life's not out to get you,
Despite the things you've been through,
Because what you give is what you get,
And it doesn't make sense to make do.

So pick yourself up,
You can't change what's been,
You must go on and learn while you live.
And when you see the signs saying hope is up ahead,
Then you're right on track for a better end.

'Cause sometimes things will bend you,
But trust me you'll be fine,
'Cause I've been moving mountains that I once had to climb.
And life's not out to get you,
Despite the things you've been through,
Because what you give is what you get,
Yeah, life's not out to get you
Yeah, life's not out to get you.

She goes unnoticed, she knows no limits
She craves attention, she praises an image
She prays to be sculpted by the sculptor
Oh, she don't see the light that's shining
Deeper than the eyes can find it
Maybe we have made her blind
So she tries to cover up her pain and cut her woes away
'Cause cover girls don't cry after their face is made
But there's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing, the world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful
Oh-oh, oh-oh
And you don't have to change a thing, yhe world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful
She has dreams to be an envy, so she's starving
You know, covergirls eat nothing
She says beauty is pain and there's beauty in everything
What's a little bit of hunger?
I could go a little while longer, she fades away
She don't see her perfect, she don't understand she's worth it
Or that beauty goes deeper than the surface
Oh, oh
So to all the girls that's hurting
Let me be your mirror, help you see a little bit clearer
The light that shines within
There's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing, the world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful

Water or wine, don't make me choose

When all these problems burn like hell
Maybe I just need a friend
Who never calls me crazy, crazy

You pull me off the front
Line before I run
Keep me cool, but not
Get overdone

Maybe we'll make something

I got a plan to get us out of here

Managed to save just a little bit of money
Won't have to drive too far
Just 'cross the border and into the city
You and I can both get jobs
And finally see what it means to be living
You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so we can fly away?
We gotta make a decision
Leave tonight or live and die this way
So remember when we were driving, driving in your car
Speed so fast I felt like I was drunk

And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder
And I had a feeling that I belonged
I had a feeling that I could be someone
Had a feeling that I could be someone
See my old man's got a problem
He live with the bottle that's the way it is
He says his body's too old for working
His body's too young to look like his
My mama went off and left him
She wanted more from life than he could give
I said somebody's got to take care of him
So I quit school and that's what I did
You got a fast car
We go cruising, entertain ourselves
You still ain't got a job
And I work in a market as a checkout girl
I know things will get better
You'll find work and I'll get promoted
We'll move out of the shelter
Buy a bigger house and live in the suburbs

Sirens and blink flashing lights
in a tiny nissan I?�m pushing ninety five
just try to get to you in time
but your supposed to be right here with me.

Life goes by fast when it slow down
we got older where did it go now
back in time when do we high but you and me
these memories.

Things I remembered when we were young.

When we were young. (x3)

As I pull up at your door
your eyes light up like we?�ve not met before
and just something is still the same
but everyday?�s brand new being with you.

What's the deal, yo?
I love when it's all too much
5 a.m. turn the radio up
Where's the rock 'n roll?

Call me up if you're a gangsta
Don't be fancy, just get dancy
Why so serious?

So raise your glass if you are wrong
In all the right ways, all my underdogs
We will never be, never be anything but loud
And nitty, gritty, dirty, little freaks
Won't you come on and come on and
Raise your glass!
Just come on and come on and
Raise your glass!

What part of a party don't you understand?
Wish you'd just freak out

Can't stop, coming in hot
I should be locked up right on the spot
It's so on right now

Call me up if you're a gangsta
Don't be fancy, just get dancy

Looking for a scene to cause
But the only thing I see, blue skies ahead of us
Searching for the empty half when somethings filling up the glass
I'm hopeless

It almost makes me wish for rain
When everything begins to go my way
This guilty feeling comes along with it and you know
It almost makes me wish for rain

So what it is about a broken heart
The harder times, the rougher starts
Inspiration feeds off of the deepest scars
And the easy streets well we drive apart

Fall on my head
Bring me to life again

Oh it makes me wish for rain

To settle in
When I am not on the edge of the fray

Ba-ba-ba ba-da-ba-da-ba
Ba-ba-ba ba

[First Girl:]
I think about that day
I left him at a Greyhound station
West of Santa Fé

We were seventeen, but he was sweet and it was true
Still I did what I had to do
'Cause I just knew

Summer: Sunday nights
We'd sink into our seats
Right as they dimmed out all the lights
A Technicolor world made out of music and machine
It called me to be on that screen
And live inside each scene

[First Girl & First Man:]
Without a nickel to my name
Hopped a bus, here I came
Could be brave or just insane

[First Girl, First Man & Second Man:]
We'll have to see

[First Girl:]
'Cause maybe in that sleepy town
He'll sit one day, the lights are down
He'll see my face and think of how he...

[First Girl, First Man, Second Man & Dancers:]
...used to know me

[All:]
Climb these hills
I'm reaching for the heights
And chasing all the lights that shine
And when they let you down
You'll get up off the ground
'Cause morning rolls around
And it's another day of sun

[Young Man:]
I hear 'em ev'ry day
The rhythms in the canyons
That'll never fade away
The ballads in the barrooms
Left by those who came before
They say ""you gotta want it more""
So I bang on ev'ry door

[Second Girl:]
And even when the answer's ""no""
Or when my money's running low
The dusty mic and neon glow
Are all I need

[Young Man:]
And someday as I sing my song
A small-town kid'll come along

[Second Girl & Young Man:]
That'll be the thing to push him on and go go

[All:]
Climb these hills
I'm reaching for the heights
And chasing all the lights that shine
And when they let you down
You'll get up off the ground
'Cause morning rolls around
And it's another day of sun

[Instrumental Break]

[First Girl:]
And when they let you down
The morning rolls around

[All:]
It's another day of sun
It's another day of sun
It's another day of sun
It's another day of sun
Just another day of sun
It's another day of sun
Another day has just begun
It's another day of sun

It's another day of sun

Alessia Cara,How Far I?�ll Go,"I've been standing at the edge of the water
'Long as I can remember, never really knowing why
I wish I could be the perfect daughter
But I come back to the water, no matter how hard I try
Every turn I take, every trail I track
Every path I make, every road leads back
To the place I know, where I can not go
Though I long to be
See the line where the sky meets the sea it calls me
And no one knows, how far it goes
If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me
One day I'll know, if I go there's just no telling how far I'll go
Oh oh oh, oh, oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh
I know, everybody on this island seems so happy on this island
Everything is by design
I know, everybody on this island has a role on this island
So maybe I can roll with mine
I can lead with pride, I can make us strong
I'll be satisfied if I play along
But the voice inside sings a different song
What is wrong with me?
See the light as it shines on the sea it's blinding
But no one knows, how deep it goes
And it seems like it's calling out to me, so come find me
And let me know, what's beyond that line, will I cross that line?
See the line where the sky meets the sea it calls me
And no one knows, how far it goes
If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me
One day I'll know, how far I'll go

For shiny little lonely men

'Cause like we hadn't seen each other in a month
When you, said you, needed space (what?)
Then you come around again and say
Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change, trust me
Remember how that lasted for a day?
I say, I hate you, we break up, you call me, I love you
Oh we called it off again last night
But oh, this time I'm telling you, I'm telling you
We are never ever, ever getting back together
We are never ever, ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never ever, ever, ever getting back together
Like, ever
I'm really gonna miss you picking fights
And me, falling for it screaming that I'm right
And you, would hide away and find your peace of mind
With some indie record that's much cooler than mine
Oh, you called me up again tonight
But oh, this time I'm telling you, I'm telling you

For way too many miles now
I’ve been flying with broken wings
 And now I’m falling faster to the ground

And it’s a bitter end to a story so sweet
Like a long lost friend that’s never found a way back to me
And I can’t deny these memories got me all locked up inside
And you hold the key

All that I need is this moment
To send me away with a smile on my face
I tried to leave but I turn back
On my heart remains a trace
All that I seek is this moment
All day in my mind I recreate
If there was a way to get back
This feeling of chase, of chase

All that I need is this moment
This moment…",sad,2009

Don't Leave,Seven Lions,"[Verse 1: Ellie Goulding]
Baby, I can't be what you want me to be
I've given you everything, I've sailed the sea
Baby, there's fireworks in my heart setting off
Darling, I wish you hadn't let us fall apart
I promise I'd try to let this go, but I can't breathe
If only you knew how much I'd give you everything you need
So [?] space and time around us to waste
Baby, I think I'm losing you, can see it in your face

[Chorus: Ellie Goulding]
Don't leave
Don't leave

And I need you, oh

To know what you want, know you'll never truly have it

Mark Johns,Molino,"[Verse 1]
Shadows of yesterday’s party are painting the wall
Echoes of yesterday's call, echoes are feeling so small
This place got me feeling so small
These days I've been dropping the ball
Need to pick it up, need a pick me up
Need a cup full of love and some 7Up
Just to spike it with pride
Drink it up, drink it up

[Pre-Chorus]
In some big city, a small girl
I've been big dreaming in a small world
In some bad city, a sad city
Haven't figured out where I belong yet

[Chorus]
It's after hours at Molino
I'm all alone and now I'm feeling sleepless
I'm putting ice up on my ego
I'm all alone and I know it's my weakness
Wanna put my mind to bed
Wanna get my mind there
Just wanna put my mind to rest
I'm putting ice up on my ego
It's after hours at Molino [Verse 2]
Came here with hope in my heart and it's fading away
Debating the play
Debating if I'm here to stay
So here i am feeling betrayed
Don't know if I'm stressed or just [know I'm just made?]
But I can't forget, can't leave just yet
I've got something to prove, I've got too much to lose
And I got everything to gain

[Pre-Chorus]
In some big city, a small girl
I've been big dreaming in a small world
In some bad city, a sad city
Haven't figured out where I belong yet

It's after hours at Molino
I'm all alone and now I'm feeling sleepless
I'm putting ice up on my ego
I'm all alone and I know it's my weakness
Wanna put my mind to bed
Wanna get my mind there
Just wanna put my mind to rest
I'm putting ice up on my ego
It's after hours at Molino [Bridge]
Take me round town, take me downtown
Help me bounce it back, help me rebound
I need somebody, won't you be somebody?

[Chorus]
It's after hours at Molino
I'm all alone and now I'm feeling sleepless
I'm putting ice up on my ego

Tears are bleeding from your eyes
I see the rainbow and the darkness at the same time

And you could enter mine, when you can't imagine anyone else
Ooooh, imaginary stairs, I'm out here on the edge

And invite your light
To wake my desire
I need something new
Won't you help me?

See, when I see a movie in my mind's eye
Staring through the keyhole just to catch some sunlight
Start the flicker, take the picture, yeah I'm layin' with you

I want lights to, blind me
I want peace, want to disappear
Oh oh DJ, ease my mind will you
Play that song again, cause we were in love
Before, before the rain began
And if I cry out, cover my ears
A foreign hand, and runaway horses
Restless doubt heart, in a vision
I did not see, see it coming
Now it's in my blood, now it's in my blood

A minor flaw and then it fell
I brought this house down on myself

Where is the quiet piece of home where I could breathe?
Just like a razor to my soul when I'm alone
Oh, I had this thing to call my own
I'm so confused, I cannot see
This wave of guilt is drowing me
It feels like blood is on my hands
I'd give it all for a second chance
I still don't know just what I've done
I still don't know just what I've done
I don't remember anymore what I used to be
There was a fire burning strong inside of me
Just like the soothing loving warmth of summer sun
Oh, I had this thing to call my own

And do I know, if they're still alive?

bout a girl who tried to live inside a dream 
won’t you speak, she wants to hear all of it, everything 
go to sleep, cause morning will come sooner than you think… 

looking up at the ceiling they 
listened and there wasn’t time to catch 
the feet kicked out from under me 
then I caught your eyes, please can I 
keep them with me for a future time 
they’ll help me when I try to fly

give me a book to read 
talk me your mind and let me see 
what’s crashing round inside of you 
the fire hasn’t gone out yet so 
can we climb the fire escape we’ll see 
just as far as we want to get

If you're so near

Why are we worlds apart?
Oh, we're not that different you know

I try to make sense as I go
'Cause nothing

'Cause nothing is in your soul
Why are we worlds apart?

Bob Moses,Tearing Me Up,"Let me tell you about a little situation
It's been testing my patience
Man, she was keeping me up all night
'Cause you only get so far reading faces
We were off to the races
And I thought to myself ""hold tight""
You see there was just one complication
She was already taken
And what was so wrong felt so right
She said ""no need for looking over your shoulder
When you could just come over
And we can work this out just fine""
I don't know what you want from me
So careless in my company
Oh, if all that you say is true
There'll be no getting over you
So beat down playing by your rules
If you're a joker then I'm a fool
I guess there's no catching up to you
If you don't want my affection
Don't lie, you're tearing me up
'Cause you've got, all my attention
I won't lie, you're tearing me up
I'm trying to tell your intention
When you lie, you're tearing me up
If you don't want my affection
You won't mind, you're tearing me up
It all started with a simple conversation
It was on the weekend and she was talking me up all night
Kept asking if I was only faking
She was there for taking
Showing me that she was all mine
She told me she lived just around the corner
I wanted to know her
Yeah, she was making me lose my mind
I didn't know quite what I was chasing
She left my heart racing
And all between it was just one night
I don't know what you want from me
So careless in my company
Oh, if all that you say is true
There'll be no getting over you
So beat down playing by your rules
If you're a joker, then I'm a fool

Let me breathe you in, and breathe the words in your mouth
Inside you're shivering, the silence shouts so loud
I just want to, I just want to stay around
And while my heart beats, I promise I won't let you down

[Verse 2]
If I'm somewhere else, it doesn't mean that I don't see
That you don't trust yourself, that's why you don't trust me
It makes me crazy, when you're crazy
You don't speak, you think you know me
But what you know is just skin deep

[Chorus]
If you keep building these walls, brick by brick, towers so tall
Soon I won't see you at all, 'til the concrete angel falls
I knew who you were from the start
But now I don't know who you are
Soon there'll be nothing at all, until the concrete angel falls

Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew ya

Just take your time
The clock is ticking, so stay
All you have to do is wait a second
Your hands on mine
The clock is ticking, so stay

All you have to do is... uh
All you have to do is stay

I don't wanna spend the night alone
Guess I need you, and I need to

Make it on my own, but I don't wanna grow up
We can stay forever young
Living on my sofa, drinking rum and cola
Underneath the rising sun
I could give a million reasons why
But you're going, and you know that

All you have to do is stay a minute
Just take your time
The clock is ticking, so stay
All you have to do is wait a second
Your hands on mine
The clock is ticking, so stay

All you have to do is... uh
All you have to do is stay

All you have to do is stay
So stay
Yeah

All you have to do is stay a minute
Just take your time
The clock is ticking, so stay
All you have to do is wait a second
Your hands on mine
The clock is ticking, so stay
All you have to do is stay
Stay",sad,2017

 Rilo Kiley,A Man/Me/Then Jim,"[A Man]
I had one friend in high school
Recently he hung himself with string
His note said, ""If living is the problem
Well, that's just baffling""
And at the wake I waited around
To see my ex first love
And I barely recognized her
But I knew exactly what she was thinking of
We sat quietly in the corner
Whispering close about loss
And I remembered why I loved her
And I asked her why I drove her off

[Chorus]
She said, ""The slow fade of love
It's soft edge might cut you
And our poor friend Jim, well, he just lived within
The slow fade of love""

[Me]
A woman calls my house once a week
She's always selling things
Some charity, a phone plan
Or a subscription to a magazine
And as I turned her down (I always do)
There was something trembling in her voice
I said, ""Hey, what troubles you?""
She said, ""I'm surprised you noticed
Well, my husband, he's a-leaving
And I can't convince him to stay
And he'll take our daughter with him
She wants to go with him anyway
I'm sorry I'm hard to live with
Living is the problem for me
I'm selling people things they don't want
And I don't know what you need"" [Chorus]
He said, ""The slow fade of love
And its mist might choke you
It's my gradual descent into a life I never meant
It's the slow fade of love""

[Jim]
I was driving south from Melrose
I happened upon my old lover's old house
I found myself staring at the closed up door
Like the day she threw me out
""Diana, Diana, Diana, I would die for you
I'm in love with you completely
I'm afraid that's all I can do""
She said, ""You can sleep upon my doorstep
You can promise me indifference, Jim
But my mind is made up
And I'll never let you in again""

[Chorus]
For the slow fade of love
It might hit you from below
It's your gradual descent into a life you never meant
It's the slow fade of love

It's the slow fade of love",sad,2004
Elliott Smith,Twilight ,"Haven't laughed this hard in a long time
I better stop now before I start crying
Go off to sleep in the sunshine
I don't want to see the day when it's dying
She's a sight to see, she's good to me
I'm already somebody's baby
She's a pretty thing and she knows everything
But I'm already somebody's baby
You don't deserve to be lonely
But those drugs you got won't make you feel better
Pretty soon you'll find it's the only
Little part of your life you're keeping together
I'm nice to you, I could make it through
That you're already somebody's baby
I could make you smile if you stayed a while
But how long will you stay with me baby
Because your candle burns too bright
Well, I almost forgot it was twilight
Even if I think that you are right
Well, I'm tired of being down, I got no fight
You're wonderful, when it's beautiful
But I'm already somebody's baby
And if I went with you I'd disappoint you too
Well, I'm already somebody's baby
Already somebody's baby",sad,2004
 Simon & Garfunkel,The Sounds of Silence,"[Verse 1]
Hello darkness, my old friend
I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

[Verse 2]
In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the halo of a street lamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by
The flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

[Verse 3]
And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dared
Disturb the sound of silence [Verse 4]
""Fools"", said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words, like silent raindrops fell
And echoed in the wells of silence

[Verse 5]
And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning
In the words that it was forming
And the sign said:
""The words of the prophets are
Written on the subway walls
And tenement halls
And whispered in the sound of silence.""",sad,1964
 Iron & Wine,"Flightless Bird, American Mouth","I was a quick wet boy
Diving too deep for coins
All of your straight blind eyes
Wide on my plastic toys
Then when the cops closed the fair
I cut my long baby hair
Stole me a dog eared map
And called for you everywhere
Have I found you?
Flightless bird, jealous, weeping
Or lost you?
American mouth
Big bill looming
Now I'm a fat house cat
Cursing my sore blunt tongue
Watching the warm poison rats
Curl through the wide white fence cracks
Pissing on magazine photos
Those fishing lures thrown in the cold and clean
Blood of Christ mountain stream
Have I found you?
Flightless bird, brown hair bleeding
Or lost you?
American mouth
Big bill, stuck going down",sad,2007
 David Gray,This Year's Love,"This years love had better last
Heaven knows it's high time
And I've been waiting on my own too long
But when you hold me like you do
It feels so right
I start to forget
How my heart gets torn
When that hurt gets thrown
Feeling like you can't go on
Turning circles when time again
It cuts like a knife oh yeah
If you love me got to know for sure
'Cause it takes something more this time
Than sweet sweet lies
Before I open up my arms and fall
Losing all control
Every dream inside my soul
And when you kiss me
On that midnight street
Sweep me off my feet
Singing ain't this life so sweet
This years love had better last
This years love had better last
'Cause whose to worry
If our hearts get torn
When that hurt gets thrown
Don't you know this life goes on
And won't you kiss me
On that midnight street
Sweep me off my feet
Singing ain't this life so sweet
This years love had better last
This years love had better last
This years love had better last",sad,1998

Don't let your life pass you by,
Weep not for the memories
Remember the good times that we had?
I let them slip away from us when things got bad.
How clearly I first saw you smilin' in the sun
Want to feel your warmth upon me
I want to be the one
I will remember you, will you remember me?
Don't let your life pass you by
Weep not for the memories
I'm so tired but I can't sleep
Standin' on the edge of something much to deep
It's funny how we feel so much but we cannot say a word
We are screaming inside, but we can't be heard
I will remember you, will you remember me?
Don't let your life pass you by
Weep not for the memories
I'm so afraid to love you
But more afraid to lose
Clinging to a past that doesn't let me choose
Once there was a darkness
Deep and endless night
You gave me everything you had, oh you gave me life
I will remember you, will you remember me?
Don't let your life pass you by
Weep not for the memories
I will remember you, will you remember me?
Don't let your life pass you by

I watched the whole thing fall
And I never saw the writing that was on the wall
If I'd only knew
The days were slipping past
That the good things never last
That you were crying

Summer turned to winter
And the snow it turned to rain
And the rain turned into tears upon your face
I hardly recognized the girl you are today
And, God, I hope it's not too late
Hmmm... It's not too late
'Cause you are not alone
I'm always there with you
And we'll get lost together
'Til the light comes pouring through
'Cause when you feel like you're done
And the darkness has won
Babe, you're not lost
When your world's crashing down
And you can't bear the thought
I said, babe, you're not lost

Life can show no mercy
It can tear your soul apart
It can make you feel like you've gone crazy
But you're not
Things have seemed to change
There's one thing that's still the same
In my heart you have remained
And we can fly fly fly away

'Cause you are not alone
And I am there with you
And we'll get lost together
'Til the light comes pouring through
'Cause when you feel like you're done
And the darkness has won
Babe, you're not lost
When the world's crashing down
And you can not bear the cross

When you love someone but it goes to waste

You pray for rain I pray for blindness.
If you still want me, please forgive me,
The crown of love has fallen from me.
If you still want me, please forgive me,
Because the spark is not within me.
I snuffed it out before my mom walked in my bedroom.
The only thing that you keep changin'
Is your name, my love keeps growin'
Still the same, just like a cancer,
And you won't give me a straight answer!
If you still want me, please forgive me,
The crown of love has fallen from me.
If you still want me please forgive me
Because your hands are not upon me.
I shrugged them off before my mom walked in my bedroom.
The pains of love, and they keep growin',
In my heart there's flowers growin'
On the grave of our old love,
Since you gave me a straight answer.
If you still want me, please forgive me,
The crown of love is not upon me
If you still want me, please forgive me,
Cause this crown is not within me.
It's not within me, it's not within me.

My hours are slumberless
Dearest the shadows
I live with are numberless
Little white flowers
Will never awaken you
Not where the black coach
Of sorrow has taken you
Angels have no thoughts
Of ever returning you
Would they be angry
If I thought of joining you

Gloomy is Sunday
With shadows I spend it all
My heart and I
Have decided to end it all
Soon there'll be candles
And prayers that are said I know
Let them not weep
Let them know that I'm glad to go
Death is no dream
For in death I'm caressin' you
With the last breath of my soul
I'll be blessin' you

I wake and I find you asleep
In the deep of my heart here

That my dream never haunted you
My heart is tellin' you
How much I wanted you

No blinding light or tunnels to gates of white

If heaven and hell decide that they both are satisfied
And illuminate the no's on their vacancy signs
If there's no one beside you when your soul embarks
Then I'll follow you into the dark
In Catholic school as vicious as Roman rule
I got my knuckles bruised by a lady in black
And I held my tongue as she told me,
Son, fear is the heart of love, so I never went back
You and me we've seen everything to see
From Bangkok to Calgary and the soles of your shoes
Are all worn down

A smile from a veil?
Do you think you can tell?
Did they get you to trade
Your heroes for ghosts?
Hot ashes for trees?
Hot air for a cool breeze?
Cold comfort for change?
Did you exchange
A walk on part in the war
For a lead role in a cage?
How I wish, how I wish you were here
We're just two lost souls
Swimming in a fish bowl
Year after year
Running over the same old ground
And how we found
The same old fears
Wish you were here",sad,1975

Yellow roses in the graveyard
Got no time to watch them grow
Now I bade a friend farewell
I can do whatever pleases me

I throw some clothes on in the dark
The smell of cold
Car seat is freezing
The world is sleeping
I am numb

Up the stairs to her apartment
She is balled up on the couch
Her mom and dad went down to Charlotte
They're not home to find us out
And we drive
Now that I have found someone
I'm feeling more alone
Than I ever have before

She's a brick and I'm drowning slowly
Off the coast and I'm headed nowhere
She's a brick and I'm drowning slowly

They call her name at 7:30
I pace around the parking lot
Then I walk down to buy her flowers
And sell some gifts that I got
Can't you see
It's not me you're dying for
Now she's feeling more alone
Than she ever has before She's a brick and I'm drowning slowly
Off the coast and I'm headed nowhere
She's a brick and I'm drowning slowly

As weeks went by
It showed that she was not fine
They told me, ""son, it's time to tell the truth""
She broke down, and I broke down
Cause I was tired of lying

Driving back to her apartment
For the moment we're alone
Yeah she's alone
I'm alone
Now I know it

Off the coast and I'm headed nowhere
She's a brick and I'm drowning slowly",sad,2002

I need your love
I need your love
God speed your love to me

Lonely rivers flow
To the sea, to the sea
To the open arms of the sea
Lonely rivers sigh
""Wait for me, wait for me""
I'll be coming home, wait for me Oh, my love, my darling
I've hungered, for your touch
A long, lonely time
Time goes by so slowly
And time can do so much
Are you still mine?
I need your love
I need your love
God speed your love to me

Lonely mountains gaze
At the stars, at the stars
Waiting for the dawn of the day
All alone I gaze
At the stars, at the stars
Dreaming of my love far away God speed your love to me

Lonely mountains gaze
At the stars, at the stars
Waiting for the dawn of the day
All alone I gaze
At the stars, at the stars
Dreaming of my love far away

 James Blunt,Goodbye My Lover,"Did I disappoint you or let you down?
Should I be feeling guilty or let the judges frown?
'Cause I saw the end before we'd begun,
Yes I saw you were blinded and I knew I had won.
So I took what's mine by eternal right.
Took your soul out into the night.
It may be over but it won't stop there,
I am here for you if you'd only care.
You touched my heart you touched my soul.
You changed my life and all my goals.
And love is blind and that I knew when,
My heart was blinded by you.
I've kissed your lips and held your head.
Shared your dreams and shared your bed.
I know you well, I know your smell.
I've been addicted to you.
Goodbye my lover.
Goodbye my friend.
You have been the one.
You have been the one for me.
I am a dreamer but when I wake,
You can't break my spirit - it's my dreams you take.
And as you move on, remember me,
Remember us and all we used to be
I've seen you cry, I've seen you smile.
I've watched you sleeping for a while.
I'd be the father of your child.
I'd spend a lifetime with you.
I know your fears and you know mine.
We've had our doubts but now we're fine,
And I love you, I swear that's true.
I cannot live without you.
Goodbye my lover.
Goodbye my friend.
You have been the one.
You have been the one for me.
And I still hold your hand in mine.
In mine when I'm asleep.
And I will bear my soul in time,
When I'm kneeling at your feet.
Goodbye my lover.
Goodbye my friend.
You have been the one.
You have been the one for me.
I'm so hollow, baby, I'm so hollow.
I'm so, I'm so, I'm so hollow.",sad,2004
 Alison Krauss,Whiskey Lullaby,"[Verse 1: Brad Paisley]
She put him out
Like the burning end of a midnight cigarette
She broke his heart
He spent his whole life tryin' to forget
We watched him drink his pain away
A little at a time
But he never could get drunk enough
To get her off his mind
Until the night...

[Chorus:Brad Paisley &Alison Krauss ]
He put that bottle to his head and pulled the trigger
And finally drank away her memory
Life is short, but this time it was bigger
Than the strength he had to get up off his knees
We found him with his face down in the pillow
With a note that said, ""I'll love her 'til I die""
And when we buried him beneath the willow
The Angels sang a whiskey lullaby

[Break:Brad Paisley &Alison Krauss]
La la la la la la la, la la la la la la laa
La la la la la la la, la la la la la la laa

[Verse 2: Alison Krauss]
The rumors flew
But nobody knew how much she blamed herself
For years and years
She tried to hide the whiskey on her breath
She finally drank her pain away
A little at a time
But she never could get drunk enough
To get him off her mind
Until the night.. [Chorus:Brad Paisley &Alison Krauss]
She put that bottle to her head and pulled the trigger
And finally drank away his memory
Life is short, but this time it was bigger
Than the strength she had to get up off her knees
We found her with her face down in the pillow
Clinging to his picture for dear life
We laid her next to him beneath the willow
While the Angels sang a whiskey lullaby",sad,2018

Joni Mitchell,River ,"It's coming on Christmas
They're cutting down trees
They're putting up reindeer
And singing songs of joy and peace
Oh I wish I had a river
I could skate away on
But it don't snow here
It stays pretty green
I'm going to make a lot of money
Then I'm going to quit this crazy scene
I wish I had a river
I could skate away on
I wish I had a river so long
I would teach my feet to fly
Oh I wish I had a river
I could skate away on
I made my baby cry
He tried hard to help me
You know, he put me at ease
And he loved me so naughty
Made me weak in the knees
Oh I wish I had a river
I could skate away on
I'm so hard to handle
I'm selfish and I'm sad
Now I've gone and lost the best baby
That I ever had
Oh I wish I had a river
I could skate away on
I wish I had a river so long
I would teach my feet to fly
Oh I wish I had a river

What the hell am I doing here?

I don't care if it hurts
I want to have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice

Drawing me in, and you kicking me out
Got my head spinning, no kidding, I can’t pin you down
What’s going on in that beautiful mind
I’m on your magical mystery ride
And I’m so dizzy, don’t know what hit me, but I’ll be alright
My head’s under water

You’re crazy and I’m out of my mind
'Cause all of me
Loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me
I’ll give my all to you
You’re my end and my beginning
Even when I lose I’m winning
'Cause I give you all, all of me
And you give me all, all of you
How many times do I have to tell you
Even when you’re crying you’re beautiful too
The world is beating you down, I’m around through every move
You’re my downfall, you’re my muse
My worst distraction, my rhythm and blues
I can’t stop singing, it’s ringing, in my head for you
My head’s under water
But I’m breathing fine
You’re crazy and I’m out of my mind

Risking it all, though it’s hard

Mirrors in the smoke

Sufjan Stevens,John Wayne Gacy Jr,"His father was a drinker and his mother cried in bed
Folding John Wayne's t-shirts when the swing set hit his head
The neighbors, they adored him 
For his humor and his conversation
Look underneath the house there 
Find the few living things, rotting fast, in their sleep
Oh the dead
Twenty-seven people 
Even more, they were boys, with their cars, summer jobs 
Oh my God
Ooh, are you one of them?
He dressed up like a clown for them 
With his face paint white and red
And on his best behavior 
In a dark room on the bed he kissed them all
He'd kill ten thousand people 
With a slight of his hand, running far, running fast to the dead
He took off all their clothes for them
He put a cloth on their lips, quiet hands, quiet kiss on the mouth
And in my best behavior 
I am really just like him
Look beneath the floor boards 
For the secrets I have hid",sad,2005

Shattered and tossed and worn

I could offer you a warm embrace
To make you feel my love
When the evening shadows and the stars appear
And there is no one there to dry your tears
Oh, I hold you for a million years
To make you feel my love
I know you haven't made your mind up yet
But I will never do you wrong
I've known it from the moment that we met
No doubt in my mind where you belong
I'd go hungry; I'd go black and blue
And I'd go crawling down the avenue
No, there's nothing that I wouldn't do
To make you feel my love
The storms are raging on the rolling sea
And on the highway of regret
The winds of change are blowing wild and free
You ain't seen nothing like me yet

There's nothing that I wouldn't do

Words from my cutting
Mouth to your ear or
Taut wicked pinches
From my fingers to your bitter face
That I can't heal

You will be
Somewhere in London
Living with someone
You've got some kind of family
There to turn to
And that's more than I could ever give you
A chance for calm
A hope for freedom

And left a bleeding part of me
Empty and bothered
Watching the water

Numb and falling through

Like a pain in the river
And the pain in the river
And the white sun scattered
Washed away this slow 

And we followed the river
And we followed the road
And we walked through this land
And we called it a home
But he wanted the sun
And I wanted the whole
And the white light scatters
And the sun sets low

Could she be thinking of another now

[Verse 3]
Take my hand, pull me through
There's so much I've left undone
But it's too late now in the garage

[Chorus]
And all the walls will fade to black
Can she be thinking of another

[Bridge]
They found her car still running in the garage
She'd come so far to end her life by
The rusty motor and chicken wire
By the chicken wire and the studded tire
By the rusty motor and chicken wire",sad,1998
Bright Eyes,Something Vague,"Now and again it seems worse than it is, 
But mostly the view is accurate. 
You see your breath in the air as you'll climb up the stairs 
To that coffin you call your apartment. 
And you sink in your chair, brush the snow from your hair 
And drink the cold away. 
And you're not really sure what you're doing this for 
But you need something to fill up the days. 
A few more hours. 
There's a dream in my brain that just won't go away. 
It's been stuck there since it came a few nights ago 
And I'm standing on a bridge in the town where I lived 
As a kid with my mom and my brothers.
And then the bridge disappears and I'm standing on air 
With nothing holding me. 
And I hang like a star, fucking glow in the dark, 
For all those starving eyes to see, 
Like the ones we've wished on.
But now I'm confused. Is this death really you? 
And do these dreams have any meaning? 
No. No, I think it's more like a ghost that's been following us both. 
Something vague that we're not seeing, 
Something more like a feeling.",sad,2000
Iron & Wine,Naked As We Came,"She says, ""Wake up, it's no use pretending""
I'll keep stealing, breathing her
Birds are leaving over autumn's ending
One of us will die inside these arms
Eyes wide open, naked as we came
One will spread our ashes around the yard
She says, ""If I leave before you, darling
Don't you waste me in the ground""
I lay smiling like our sleeping children
One of us will die inside these arms
Eyes wide open, naked as we came
One will spread our ashes around the yard",sad,2004
Amy Winehouse,Back to Black,"He left no time to regret
Kept his dick wet
With his same old safe bet
Me and my head high
And my tears dry
Get on without my guy
You went back to what you knew
So far removed from all that we went through
And I tread a troubled track
My odds are stacked
I'll go back to black
We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her
And I go back to
I go back to us
I love you much
It's not enough
You love blow, and I love puff
And life is like a pipe
And I'm a tiny penny rolling up the walls inside
We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her
And I go back to
We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her

Sufjan Stevens,Casimir Pulaski Day,"Goldenrod and the 4H stone
The things I brought you
When I found out you had cancer of the bone
Your father cried on the telephone
And he drove his car into the navy yard
Just to prove that he was sorry
In the morning, through the window shade
When the light pressed up against your shoulder blade
I could see what you were reading
All the glory that the Lord has made
And the complications you could do without
When I kissed you on the mouth
Tuesday night at the Bible study
We lift our hands and pray over your body
But nothing ever happens
I remember at Michael's house
In the living room when you kissed my neck
And I almost touched your blouse
In the morning at the top of the stairs
When your father found out what we did that night
And you told me you were scared
All the glory when you ran outside
With your shirt tucked in and your shoes untied
And you told me not to follow you
Sunday night when I cleaned the house
I find the card where you wrote it out
With the pictures of you mother
On the floor at the great divide
With my shirt tucked in and my shoes untied
I am crying in the bathroom
In the morning when you finally go
And the nurse runs in with her head hung low
And the cardinal hits the window
In the morning in the winter shade
On the 1st of March on the holiday
I thought I saw you breathing
All the glory that the Lord has made
And the complications when I see His face
In the morning in the window
All the glory when he took our place
But he took my shoulders and he shook my face
And he takes and he takes and he takes",sad,2005

And as I climb into an empty bed 
Oh well. Enough said. 
I know it's over - still I cling 
I don't know where else I can go 
Oh...
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head 
See, the sea wants to take me 
The knife wants to slit me 
Do you think you can help me?
Sad veiled bride, please be happy 
Handsome groom, give her room 
Loud, loutish lover, treat her kindly

More than she loves you)

I don't know where else I can go 
Over and over and over and over 
Over and over, la...
I know it's over

Then why are you on your own tonight ? 
And if you're so clever 
Then why are you on your own tonight ? 
If you're so very entertaining 
Then why are you on your own tonight ? 
If you're so very good-looking 
Why do you sleep alone tonight ?

'Cause tonight is just like any other night 
That's why you're on your own tonight 
With your triumphs and your charms 
While they're in each other's arms...""

A job that slowly kills you
Bruises that won't heal

A handshake of carbon monoxide

My final bellyache

Who fall behind

Everybody goes, as far as they can

Who live in small city of Japan
And you heard me on the radio
About one year ago
And you wanted to know
All about me and my hobbies
My favorite food and my birthday 

Why are you so far away from me?
I need help and you're way across the sea
I could never touch you
I think it would be wrong
I've got your letter
You've got my song 

They don't make stationery like this where I'm from
So fragile, so refined
So I sniff and I lick your envelope
And fall to little pieces every time
I wonder what clothes you wear to school
I wonder how you decorate your room
I wonder how you touch yourself
And curse myself for being across the sea 

Why are you so far away from me?
I need help and you're way across the sea
I could never touch you
I think it would be wrong
I've got your letter
You've got my song 

At 10 I shaved my head and tried to be a monk
I thought the older women would like me if I did
You see, ma, I'm a good little boy
It's all your fault, momma, it's all your fault
Goddamn, this business is really lame
I gotta live on an island to find the juice
So you send me your love from all around the world
As if I could live on words and dreams and a million screams
Oh how I need a hand in mine, to feel 

Why are you so far away from me?
Why are you so far away from me?

I can see whomever I choose
I can eat my dinner in a fancy restaurant
But nothing
I said nothing can take away these blues
'Cause nothing compares
Nothing compares to you
It's been so lonely without you here
Like a bird without a song
Nothing can stop these lonely tears from falling
Tell me baby where did I go wrong
I could put my arms around every boy I see
But they'd only remind me of you
I went to the doctor and guess what he told me?
Guess what he told me?
He said girl you better try to have fun 
No matter what you do, but he's a fool
'Cause nothing compares
Nothing compares to you
All the flowers that you planted mama
In the back yard
All died when you went away
I know that living with you baby was sometimes hard
But I'm willing to give it another try
'Cause nothing compares
Nothing compares to you

The Cure,Pictures of You,"I've been looking so long at these pictures of you
That I almost believe that they're real 
I've been living so long with my pictures of you
That I almost believe that the pictures 
Are all I can feel
Remembering you standing quiet in the rain 
As I ran to your heart to be near 
And we kissed as the sky fell in
Holding you close 
How I always held close in your fear
Remembering you running soft through the night 
You were bigger and brighter and wider than snow
And screamed at the make-believe 
Screamed at the sky
And you finally found all your courage 
To let it all go
Remembering you fallen into my arms 
Crying for the death of your heart 
You were stone white
So delicate 
Lost in the cold 
You were always so lost in the dark
Remembering you how you used to be 
Slow drowned 
You were angels
So much more than everything 
Hold for the last time then slip away quietly 
Open my eyes 
But I never see anything
If only I'd thought of the right words 
I could have held on to your heart 
If only I'd thought of the right words
I wouldn't be breaking apart 
All my pictures of you
Looking so long at these pictures of you 
But I never hold on to your heart 
Looking so long for the words to be true
But always just breaking apart
My pictures of you
There was nothing in the world
That I ever wanted more 
Than to feel you deep in my heart
There was nothing in the world 
That I ever wanted more
Than to never feel the breaking apart
All my pictures of you",sad,1989
The Cinematic Orchestra,To Build a Home,"There is a house built out of stone
Wooden floors, walls and window sills
Tables and chairs worn by all of the dust

This is a place where I feel at home
'Cause, I built a home
For you
For me
Until it disappeared
From me
From you
And now, it's time to leave and turn to dust
Out in the garden where we planted the seeds
There is a tree as old as me
Branches were sewn by the color of green
Ground had arose and passed it's knees
By the cracks of the skin I climbed to the top
I climbed the tree to see the world
When the gusts came around to blow me down
I held on as tightly as you held onto me
I held on as tightly as you held onto me
And, I built a home
For you
For me
Until it disappeared
From me
From you
And now, it's time to leave and turn to dust",sad,2007

No tomorrow, no tomorrow
And I find it kinda funny, I find it kinda sad
The dreams in which I'm dying are the best I've ever had
I find it hard to tell you, I find it hard to take

Happy birthday, happy birthday
Made to feel the way that every child should
Sit and listen, sit and listen
Went to school and I was very nervous

Look right through me, look right through me

You're living for nothing now, I hope you're keeping some kind of record

She said that you gave it to her
That night that you planned to go clear
Did you ever go clear?

Ah, the last time we saw you you looked so much older
Your famous blue raincoat was torn at the shoulder
You'd been to the station to meet every train, and
You came home without Lili Marlene

And you treated my woman to a flake of your life
And when she came back she was nobody's wife

Well I see you there with the rose in your teeth
One more thin gypsy thief
Well, I see Jane's awake
She sends her regards

And what can I tell you my brother, my killer
What can I possibly say?
I guess that I miss you, I guess I forgive you
I'm glad you stood in my way

If you ever come by here, for Jane or for me
Well, your enemy is sleeping, and his woman is free

Yes, and thanks, for the trouble you took from her eyes
I thought it was there for good so I never tried

 Elliott Smith,King's Crossing,"The big problem is the main attraction
Dominoes are falling in a chain reaction
The scraping subject ruled by fear told me
Whiskey works better than beer
The judge is on vinyl, decisions are final
And nobody gets a reprieve
And every wave is tidal - if you hang around
You're going to get wet
I can't prepare for death any more than I already have
All you can do now is watch the shells
The game looks easy that's why it sells
Frustrated fireworks inside your head
Are going to stand and deliver talk instead
The method acting that pays my bills
Keeps the fat man feeding in beverly hills
I got a heavy metal mouth that hurls obscenity
And I get my check from the trash treasury
'Cause I took my own insides out
It don't matter 'cause I had no sex life
All I want to do now is inject my ex wife
I've seen the movie and I know what happens
It's a Christmas time

His voice is overwhelming, but his speech is slurred
And I only understand every other word

It's a hell of a role if you can keep it alive
But I don't care if I fuck up
I'm going on a date with a rich white lady
Ain't life great?
Give me one good reason not to do it
This is a place where time reverses
Dead men talk to all the pretty nurses
Instruments shine on a silver tray
Don't let me be carried away
Don't let me be carried away
Don't let me be carried away",sad,2004
Bruce Springsteen,The Promise,"[Verse]
Johnny works in a factory
And Billy works downtown
Terry works in a rock and roll band
Looking for that million dollar sound

And I got a little job down in Darlington
But some nights I don't go
Some nights I go to the drive-in
Or some nights I stay home

I followed that dream
Just like those guys do up on the screen
And I drove a Challenger down Route 9
Through the dead ends and all the bad scenes
And when the promise was broken
I cashed in a few of my dreams

Well now I built that Challenger by myself
But I needed money and so I sold it
I lived a secret I shoulda kept to myself
But I got drunk one night and I told it

All my life, I fought this fight
The fight that no man can ever win
Every day it just gets harder to live
The dream I'm believing in [Chorus]
Thunder Road
Oh baby, you were so right
Thunder Road
There's something dying down on the highway tonight

[Verse]
I won big once and I hit the coast
Oh, but somehow I paid the big cost
Inside I felt like I was carrying the broken spirits
Of all the other ones who lost

When the promise is broken
You go on living, but it steals something from down in your soul
Like when the truth is spoken, and it don't make no difference
Something in your heart turns cold

[Chorus]
Thunder Road
Is for the lost lovers and all the fixed games
Thunder Road
For the tires rushing by in the rain
Thunder Road
Me and Billy we'd always sing
Thunder Road
We were gonna take it all and throw it all away This line is from a different song, but I can't delete it because of the annotation, so pretend it's not here
The promise was broken, I was far away from home
Sleeping in the back seat of a borrowed car",sad,2010
Bonnie Raitt,I Can't Make You Love Me,"Turn down the lights
Turn down the bed
Turn down these voices inside my head
Lay down with me
Tell me no lies
Just hold me close, don't patronize
Don't patronize me
'Cause I can't make you love me if you don't
You can't make your heart feel something it won't
Here in the dark, in these final hours
I will lay down my heart and I'll feel the power
But you won't, no you won't
'Cause I can't make you love me, if you don't
I'll close my eyes, then I won't see
The love you don't feel when you're holding me
Morning will come and I'll do what's right
Just give me till then to give up this fight
And I will give up this fight
'Cause I can't make you love me if you don't
You can't make your heart feel something it won't
Here in the dark, in these final hours
I will lay down my heart and I'll feel the power
But you won't, no you won't

Frank Ocean,BAD RELIGION,"[Verse 1]
Taxi driver
Be my shrink for the hour
Leave the meter running
It's rush hour
So take the streets if you wanna
Just outrun the demons, could you?
He said ""allahu akbar"", I told him don't curse me
""But boy you need prayer"", I guess it couldn't hurt me
If it brings me to my knees
It's a bad religion

[Chorus]
This unrequited love
To me it's nothing but
A one-man cult
And cyanide in my styrofoam cup
I could never make him love me
Never make him love me
Love, love...

[Verse 2]
Taxi driver
I swear I've got three lives
Balanced on my head like steak knives
I can't tell you the truth about my disguise
I can't trust no one
And you say ""allahu akbar"", I told him don't curse me
""But boy you need prayer"", I guess it couldn't hurt me
If it brings me to my knees
It's a bad religion

This unrequited love
To me it's nothing but
A one-man cult
And cyanide in my styrofoam cup
I could never make him love me
Never make him love me

GLASS ANIMALS,AGNES,"Agnes just stop and think a minute
Why don't you light that cigarette and
Calm down now stop and breathe a second
Go back to the very beginning

Can't you see what was different then?
You were just popping Percocet
Maybe just four a week at best
Maybe a smoke to clear the head

Your head is so numb
That nervous breath you try to hide
Between the motions
That trembling tender little sigh

And so it goes
A choking rose back
To be reborn
I want to hold you like you're mine

You see the sad in everything a
Genius of love and loneliness and
This time you overdid the liquor
This time you pulled the fuckin' trigger

These days you're rolling all the time
So low so you keep getting high
Where went that cheeky friend of mine?
Where went that billion dollar smile?

Guess life is long
When soaked in sadness
On borrowed time
From Mr Madness

And so it goes
A choking rose back
To be reborn
I want to hold you like you're mine

You're gone but you're on my mind
I'm lost but I don't know why",sad,2016

I won't stop you from leaving

Wanted someone who I used to be like

Well, don't argue it's not worth the effort to lie
You don't want to bring it up
And I already know how we look
You don't have to remind me so much
How I disappoint you
It's just that I talked to somebody again
That knows how to help me get better
Until then I should just try not to miss anymore
Appointments

I think if I ruin this
That I know I can live with it
Nothing turns out like I pictured it
Maybe the emptiness is just a lesson in canvases
I think if I fail again
That I know you're still listening
Maybe it's all gonna turn out alright
And I know that it's not, but I have to believe that it is

I have to believe that it is
I have to believe that it is
(I have to believe it, I have to believe it)
I have to believe that it is
(Probably not, but I have to believe that it is)

When did it get so damn cold
You're so seasonal
We flickered and swayed
Each time the winter soul came
I remember gold days
Under love's warm haze
Old flame, you're still the one that holds me
Can't you feel it burning
Can't you feel it burning still
Old flame, I fell for your inferno
Where did all the love go
Can't you feel the wind blow you closer to me
I went by your house today
When did you get so hollow
So closed, so overgrown
But I flicker and sway
Still dancing on the aftertaste
I remember gold days
Wrapped up in the warmth we made
Old flame, you're still the one that holds me
Can you feel it burning
Can you feel it burning still
Old flame, I fell for your inferno
Where did all the love go
Can't you feel the wind blow
Smoke skies, colors and cloud nines
Circles and straight lines and drowned eyes
(When there's something in the air)
From such heights, I fell into Fahrenheit
And time only fuels the desire
(When there's something in the air)
It's always the old way
When did it get so damn cold
You're so seasonal

Burning, burning still
Old flame, inferno
Where did all the love go

I'd be sad that I never held your hand as you were lowered
But I'd understand that the world does what it does
And you never did learn to let the little things go
And you never did learn to let me be
And you never did learn to let little people grow
And you never did learn how to see
But I whisper that I love this man
Now and for forever to your soul as it floats out of the window
To the world that you turned your back on
To the world that never really let you be
And I am Laura now, and Laura still
And you did always say that one day I would suffer
You did always say that people get their pay
You did always say that I was going places
And that you wouldn't have it any other way
But I couldn't turn my back on a world for what I like, wouldn't let me
But I couldn't turn my back on a world for what I like, I needed

To move on with my mind, there's nothing left

Now I want more
(I want more those feelings crawling up spine)
Every day I want more of the night
I want more of you

I've been waiting for you to call my bluff
I can feel the difference, steam and smoke
Clouds in my mind, these bones are dry
You know I've been trying to get it right
Steel between my veins, can't describe
But this fire's nice, these shadows lie

PHOENIX,IF I EVER FEEL BETTER,"They say an end can be a start
Feels like I've been buried yet I'm still alive
It's like a bad day that never ends
I feel the chaos around me
A thing I don't try to deny
I'd better learn to accept that
There are things in my life that I can't control
They say love ain't nothing but a sore
I don't even know what love is
Too many tears have had to fall
Don't you know I'm so tired of it all
I have known terror dizzy spells
Finding out the secrets words won't tell
Whatever it is it can't be named
There's a part of my world that' s fading away
You know I don't want to be clever
To be brilliant or superior
True like ice, true like fire
Now I know that a breeze can blow me away
Now I know there's much more dignity
In defeat than in the brightest victory
I'm losing my balance on the tight rope
Tell me please, tell me please, tell me please
If I ever feel better
Remind me to spend some good time with you
You can give me your number
When it's all over I'll let you know
Hang on to the good days
I can lean on my friends
They help me going through hard times
But I'm feeding the enemy
I'm in league with the foe
Blame me for what's happening
I can't try, I can't try, I can't try
No one knows the hard times I went through
If happiness came I miss the call
The stormy days ain't over
I've tried and lost know I think that I pay the cost
Now I've watched all my castles fall
They were made of dust, after all
Someday all this mess will make me laugh

There are things in my life I can't control
I feel the chaos around me
A thing I don't try to deny
I'd better learn to accept that
There's a part of my life that will go away
Dark is the night, cold is the ground
In the circular solitude of my heart

Holding me closer 'til our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone, wait for me to come home
Loving can heal, loving can mend your soul
And it's the only thing that I know, know
I swear it will get easier
Remember that with every piece of you
Hm, and it's the only thing we take with us when we die
Hm, we keep this love in this photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts were never broken
And time's forever frozen still
So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me closer 'til our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone
And if you hurt me
That's okay baby, only words bleed
Inside these pages you just hold me
And I won’t ever let you go
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Oh, you can fit me
Inside the necklace you got when you were sixteen
Next to your heartbeat where I should be
Keep it deep within your soul
And if you hurt me
Well, that's okay baby, only words bleed
Inside these pages you just hold me
And I won’t ever let you go
When I'm away, I will remember how you kissed me
Under the lamppost back on Sixth street
Hearing you whisper through the phone
""Wait for me to come home""",sad,2014
Rihanna ,Stay,"All along it was a fever
A cold sweat hot-headed believer
I threw my hands in the air, said, ""Show me something""
He said, ""If you dare, come a little closer""
Round and around and around and around we go
Oh now, tell me now, tell me now, tell me now you know
Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
It takes me all the way
I want you to stay
It's not much of a life you're living
It's not just something you take it's given
Round and around and around and around we go
Oh now, tell me now, tell me now, tell me now you know
Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
It takes me all the way
I want you to stay
Ooh, ooh, ooh, the reason I hold on
Ooh, ooh, ooh, 'cause I need this hole gone
Funny you're the broken one but I'm the only one who needed saving
'Cause when you never see the light it's hard to know which one of us is caving
Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
It takes me all the way
I want you to stay, stay
I want you to stay, hooh",sad,2012
Katy Perry,The One That Got Away,"Summer after high school, when we first met
We make-out in your Mustang to Radiohead
And on my eighteenth birthday, we got matching tattoos
Used to steal your parents liquor and climb to the roof
Talk about our future like we had a clue
Never planned that one day I'd be losing you
In another life, I would be your girl
We keep all our promises, be us against the world
In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away
The one that got away
I was June and you were my Johnny Cash
Never one without the other, we made a pact
Sometimes when I miss you, I put those records on, whoa
Someone said you had your tattoo removed
Saw you downtown, singing the blues
It's time to face the music, I'm no longer your muse
In another life, I would be your girl
We keep all our promises, be us against the world
In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away
The one that got away
The one, the one, the one
The one that got away
All this money can't buy me a time machine, no
Can't replace you with a million rings, no
I should'a told you what you meant to me, whoa
Cause now I pay the price
In another life, I would be your girl
We keep all our promises, be us against the world
In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away
The one that got away
The one (the one)
The one (the one)

In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away

Ellie Goulding,I Know You Care,"Clinging to me
Like a last breath you would breathe
You were like home to me
I don't recognize the street
Please don't close your eyes
Don't know where to look without them
Outside the cars speed by
I never heard them until now
I know you care, I know it is always been there
But there is trouble ahead I can feel it
You are just saving yourself when you hide it
Yeah, I know you care
I see it in the way that you stare
As if there was trouble ahead, and you knew it
I'll be saving myself from the ruin
And I know you care
I use to run down the stairs, to the door
And I thought you were there
To shape to the comfort of us
Two lovers loved out of love
Oh, but I know you care
I know it is always been there
But there is trouble ahead I can feel it
You are just saving yourself when you hide it
Yeah, I know you care
I see it in the way that you stare
As if there was trouble ahead, and you knew it
I'll be saving myself from the ruin
I know it wasn't always wrong
But I've never known a winter so cold
Now I don't want my hands in a coat
But I still hope
'Cause this is how things ought to have been
And I know the worst of it wasn't all that it seemed
Why can't I dream?
Do I care to dream?
'Cause I know you care
And I know you care
I know you care
I know you care
I know it's always been there",sad,2012
Sam Smith,I'm Not The Only One,"You and me we made a vow
For better or for worse
I can't believe you let me down
But the proof is in the way it hurts
For months on end I've had my doubts
Denying every tear
I wish this would be over now
But I know that I still need you here
You say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one
You've been so unavailable
Now sadly I know why
Your heart is unobtainable
Even though you don't share mine
You say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one
I have loved you for many years
Maybe I am just not enough
You've made me realize my deepest fear
By lying and tearing us up
You say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done

I know I'm not the only one
You say I'm crazy

Or would you run and never look back?
Would you cry if you saw me crying?
And would you save my soul tonight?
Would you tremble if I touched your lips?
Or would you laugh? Oh, please tell me this
Now would you die for the one you love?
Oh hold me in your arms tonight
I can be your hero baby
I can kiss away the pain
I will stand by you forever
You can take my breath away
Would you swear that you'll always be mine
Or would you lie? Would you run and hide?
Am I in too deep? Have I lost my mind?
I don't care, you're here tonight

Take my hand
Why are we
Strangers when
Our love is strong
Why carry on without me

Without my wings
I feel so small
I guess I need you baby

You in my dreams
I see your face
It's haunting me
I guess I need you baby
I make-believe
That you are here
It's the only way 
That I see clear 
What have I done
You seem to move on easy
Every time I try to fly I fall
Without my wings
I feel so small
I guess I need you baby 
And every time I see
You in my dreams
I see your face
You're haunting me
I guess I need you baby
I may have made it rain
Please forgive me
My weakness caused you pain
And this song's my sorry
At night I pray
That soon your face will fade away

You in my dreams
I see your face
You're haunting me

5 Seconds Of Summer,Amnesia,"I drove by all the places we used to hang out getting wasted
I thought about our last kiss, how it felt the way you tasted
And even though your friends tell me you're doing fine
Are you somewhere feeling lonely even though he's right beside you?
When he says those words that hurt you, do you read the ones I wrote you?
Sometimes I start to wonder, was it just a lie?
If what we had was real, how could you be fine?
'Cause I'm not fine at all
I remember the day you told me you were leaving
I remember the make-up running down your face
And the dreams you left behind you didn't need them
Like every single wish we ever made
I wish that I could wake up with amnesia
And forget about the stupid little things
Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you
And the memories I never can escape
'Cause I'm not fine at all
The pictures that you sent me they're still living in my phone
I'll admit I like to see them, I'll admit I feel alone
And all my friends keep asking why I'm not around
It hurts to know you're happy, yeah, it hurts that you've moved on
It's hard to hear your name when I haven't seen you in so long
It's like we never happened, was it just a lie?
If what we had was real, how could you be fine?
'Cause I'm not fine at all
I remember the day you told me you were leaving
I remember the make-up running down your face
And the dreams you left behind you didn't need them
Like every single wish we ever made
I wish that I could wake up with amnesia
And forget about the stupid little things
Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you
And the memories I never can escape
If today I woke up with you right beside me
Like all of this was just some twisted dream
I'd hold you closer than I ever did before
And you'd never slip away
And you'd never hear me say
I remember the day you told me you were leaving
I remember the make-up running down your face
And the dreams you left behind you didn't need them
Like every single wish we ever made
I wish that I could wake up with amnesia
And forget about the stupid little things
Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you

The quiet one with good intentions
He was down with his brother, respectful
to his mother
A good boy

One kid with the promise
The brightest kid in school, he's not a fool
Reading books 'bout science and smart stuff
It's not enough, no
'Cause smart don't make you cool
Well he's not invisible anymore
With his father's nine and a broken fuse
Since he walked through that classroom door
He's all over prime time news
Mary's got the same size hands as
Marilyn Monroe
She put her fingers in the imprints
At Mann's Chinese Theatre Show
She could've been a movie star
Never got the chance to go that far
Her life was stole Oh Oh, now we'll never know
They're crying to the camera
Said he never fitted in, he wasn't welcome
He'd show up to the parties we was hanging in
Some guys were putting him down, bullin' him 'round
Now I wish I would have talked to him
Gave him the time of day, not turn away
If I would've then it wouldn't maybe go this far
He'd might'a stayed at home playing
angry chords on his guitar
He's not invisible anymore
With his baggy pants and his legs in chains
Since he walked through that classroom door
Everybody knows his name
Mary's got the same size hands as
Marilyn Monroe
She put her fingers in the imprints
At Mann's Chinese Theatre Show
She could've been a movie star
Never got the chance to go that far

Hoping you would come around
I've been giving out chances every time
And all you do is let me down
And it's taken me this long
Baby but I figured you out
And you're thinking we'll be fine again
But not this time around

You don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you baby
Like I did before
You're not sorry... no, no, no, no

You are looking so innocent
I might believe you if I didn't know
Could've loved you all my life
If you hadn't left me waiting in the cold
And you got your share of secrets
And I'm tired of being last to know
And now you're asking me to listen
Cause it's worked each time before

But you don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you baby
Like I did before
You're not sorry... no, no, no

You're not sorry... no, no, no

You had me crawling for you honey
And it never would've gone away, no
You used to shine so bright
But I watched all of it fade

So you don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
There's nothing left to beg for
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you baby
Like I did before
You're not sorry... no, no, no

You're not sorry... no, no, no

The words that you needed so bad
And I'm kicking the dirt cause I never gave you
The things that you needed to have
I'm so sad, sad

Man, it's been a long night
Just sitting here trying not to look back
Still looking at the road we never drove on
And wondering if the one I chose was the right one

No matter how much I try they never cover my feet
I need you, God I need you, why do I?

Maybe we'll make something

I got a plan to get us out of here
I been working at the convenience store
Managed to save just a little bit of money
Won't have to drive too far
Just 'cross the border and into the city
You and I can both get jobs
And finally see what it means to be living
You see my old man's got a problem
He live with the bottle that's the way it is
He says his body's too old for working
His body's too young to look like his
My mama went off and left him
She wanted more from life than he could give
I said somebody's got to take care of him
So I quit school and that's what I did
You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so we can fly away
We gotta make a decision
Leave tonight or live and die this way
So remember we were driving, driving in your car
Speed so fast I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder
I had a feeling that I belonged
I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone
You got a fast car
We go cruising to entertain ourselves
You still ain't got a job
I work in a market as a checkout girl
I know things will get better
You'll find work and I'll get promoted
We'll move out of the shelter
Buy a bigger house and live in the suburbs
I remember we were driving, driving in your car
Speed so fast I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder
I had a feeling that I belonged
I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone
You got a fast car
I got a job that pays all our bills
You stay out drinking late at the bar
See more of your friends than you do of your kids
I'd always hoped for better
Thought maybe together you and me would find it
I got no plans I ain't going nowhere
So take your fast car and keep on driving
I remember we were driving, driving in your car
Speed so fast I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us

That it was wrong or it was right

And I don't know if I could stand another hand upon you

And I won't be far from where you are if ever you should call

Turning circles when time again
It cuts like a knife oh yeah

Than sweet sweet lies
Before I open up my arms and fall
Losing all control
Every dream inside my soul
And when you kiss me
On that midnight street
Sweep me off my feet
Singing ain't this life so sweet
This years love had better last
This years love had better last

If our hearts get torn
When that hurt gets thrown

Well I would have known
What I was living for all along
What I've been living for

Where only the sweetest words remain
Every kiss is a cursive line
Every touch is a redefining phrase
I surrender who I've been for who you are
For nothing makes me stronger than your fragile heart
If I had only felt how it feels to be yours
Well I would have known
What I've been living for all along

It's the one that I did with you here
It seems careless that I shouldn't care less
But it's the only noise I have of yours
I'm so tired because you've been so fired up
And there was no keeping up with you.
It's no triumph I knew I was for the high jump
But I delighted in my best mistake.
I only thought of me.
I only thought of me.
Now you're all I see.
Now you're all I see.
Reading backwards I see where the attack was
Which in real time came out of the blue.
It's the weakness that I love this bleakness
Over any constant happiness.
Shake me out of this.
Take me out of this.
Carry me with love.
Bury me in love.",sad,2006

Dallas Green,Sleeping Sickness,"I awoke, only to find my lungs empty
And through the night, so it seems I'm not breathing
And now my dreams, are nothing like they were meant to be
And I'm breaking down, I think I'm breaking down
And I'm afraid, to sleep because of what haunts me
Such as, living with the uncertainty
That'll never find the words to say
Which would completely explain, just how I'm breaking down
Someone come and, someone come and save my life
Maybe I'll sleep when I am dead but now it's like the night is taking sides
And all the worries that occupy the back of my mind
Could it be, this misery will suffice
I've become, a simple souvenir of someone's kill
Like the sea, I'm constantly changing from calm to ill
Madness fills my heart and soul as if the
Great divide could swallow me whole, oh how I'm breaking down
Someone come and, someone come and save my life
Maybe I'll sleep when I am dead but now it's like the night is taking sides
And all the worries that occupy the back of my mind

Sometimes I cry so hard from pleading
So sick and tired of all the needless beating

Down and out

Another dollar's just another blow

You're trying your hardest
And the hardest part is
Letting go of the nights we shared
Ocala is calling
And you know it's haunting
But compared to your eyes
Nothing shines quite as bright
And when we look to the sky
It's not mine, but I want it so

Let's not pretend like you're alone tonight

You're probably hanging out and making eyes
(While across the room he stares)
I'll bet he gets the nerve to walk the floor
And ask my girl to dance, and she'll say yes

Because these words were never easier for me to say
Or her to second guess
But I guess
That I can live without you but
Without you I'll be miserable at best

You're all that I hoped I'd find
In every single way
And everything I would give
Is everything you couldn't take
'Cause nothing feels like home,
You're a thousand miles away
And the hardest part of living
Is just taking breaths to stay
'Cause I know I'm good for something
I just haven't found it yet
But I need it

That I'll talk to you and I can't speak
It's been three whole days since I've had sleep
'Cause I dream of his lips on your cheek
And I got the point that I should leave you alone
But we both know that I'm not that strong and
I miss the lips that made me fly

Death Cab for Cutie,The Ice Is Getting Thinner,"We're not the same, dear, as we used to be
The seasons have changed and so have we
There was little we could say, and even less we could do
To stop the ice from getting thinner under me and you
We bury our love in the wintery grave
A lump in the snow was all that remained
But we stayed by its side as the days turned to weeks
And the ice kept getting thinner with every word that we'd speak
And when spring arrived
We were taken by surprise when the floes under our feet bled into the sea
And nothing was left for you and me
We're not the same, dear
And it seems to me
There's nowhere we can go
With nothing underneath
And it saddens me to say
But we both know, well, it's true
That the ice was getting thinner
Under me and you
The ice was getting thinner
Under me and you",sad,2008

Our Lady Peace,Are You Sad,"Your life has been so hard
It's dried up angels that can't keep guard
I'm trying to reach your hand
But I'm on fire
I never planned to fade... away
Stay with me
Stop pretending when they say that you're nothing

Are you sad?
Are you holding yourself?
Are you locked in your room?
You shouldn't be..

I'm drowning inside your head
Help me to answer
Help understand
Why it's been so long since we talked like friends
Please, forgive me,
I'm just a man
Whose made mistakes

Stop pretending when they say you're nothing

Are you sad?
Are you holding yourself?
Are you locked in your room?
You shouldn't be..",sad,2000
Okkervil River,For Real,"Some nights I thirst for real blood
For real knives, for real cries
And then the flash of steel from real guns
In real life really fills my mind

I really miss what really did exist
When I held your throat so tight
And I miss the bus as it swerved from us
And came crashing to its side

Some nights the blood from real cuts
Feels real nice when it's really mine
And if you want it to be real
Come over for one night
And we can really, really climb

Cause blue bridge lights
Might really burn most bright
While we watch that dark lake rise
And if you really want to see
What really matters most to me
Just take a real short drive

It’s just a drive into the dark stretch
Long stretch of night
Really stretch this shaking mind
And this room, unlit, unheated
And the ceiling striped
And the dark black blinds
I want to know this time If you're really finally mine
I need to know that you're not lying
And so I want to see you tried
And I don't want to hear you say
It shouldn't really be this way
Because I like this way just fine

'Cause there's nothing quite like
The blinding light
That curtains cast aside
And no attempt is made to explain away
Things that really, really, really, really, really are behind

You can't hide, you can't hide, you can't hide
You can't hide, you can't hide, you can't hide",sad,2005
Johnny Cash,Hurt,"I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything
What have I become
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liars chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I am still right here
What have I become
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
If I could start again
A million miles away
I will keep myself
I would find a way",sad,2002
Rascal Flatts,I’m Moving On,"I've dealt with my ghosts and faced all my demons
Finally content with a past I regret
I've found you find strength in your moments of weakness
For once I'm at peace with myself
I've been burdened with blame, trapped in the past for too long
I'm movin' on
I've lived in this place and I know all the faces
Each one is different but they're always the same
They mean no harm but it's time that I face it
They'll never allow me to change
But I never dreamed home would end up where I don't belong
I'm movin' on
I'm movin' on
At last I can see life has been patiently waiting for me
And I know there's no guarentee's, but I'm not alone
There comes a time in everyone's life
When all you can see are the years passing by
And I have made up my mind that those days are gone
I sold what I could and packed what I couldn't
Stopped to fill up on my way out of town
I've loved like I should but lived like
I shouldn't
I had to lose everything to find out
Maybe forgiveness will find me somewhere down this road
I'm movin' on
I'm movin' on
I'm movin' on",sad,2000
Little Texas,What Might Have Been,"Sure I think about you now and then
But it's been a long, long time
Well I've got a good life now, I moved on
So when you cross my mind
I try not to think about what might have been
Cause that was then and 
We have taken different roads
We can't go back again 
There's no use giving in 
And theres no way to know 
What might have been

We can sit and talk about this all night long
And wonder why we didn't last
Yes, they might be the best days we will ever know
But we'll have to leave them in the past

So try not to think about what might have been
Cause that was then 
And we have taken different roads
We can't go back again
There's no use giving in
And there's no way to know
What might have been

Same old look in your eyes,
It's a beautiful night
I'm so tempted to stay
But too much time has gone by 
We should just say goodbye
And turn and walk away

Try not to think about what might have been
Cause that was then and we have taken different roads
We can't go back again 
There's no use giving in
And there's no way to know
What might have been 

No we'll never know
What might have been.",sad,1993

How long have I been a memory?
I've got to know for my own sanity.
Tell me when did you stop lovin' me?

Was it that night that you stayed out until dawn?
You know that night has haunted me for so long.
Or was your love already cold?
Tell me please I got to know.
Darlin' when did you stop lovin' me?

There was a time when you worshipped where I stood.
Heaven knows I'd bring it back if I could.

It ain't me you're thinkin' of.

Maybe, the one who is waiting for you

Just can't get my poorself together

If he stays away old rockin' chair will get me

With my heart on the floor
I must be out of my mind
To come back begging for more

Swear that I'm yours

And these flies kept me sleeping
For my fear's on their wings
And your grandfather clock is still ticking
But the chime never rings
And how long must I stay
Will I lay by your side
Just to say that I'm yours
Oh, and you'll never be mine

Swallowed my soul
Dragging me down
There's blood on the covers
From curses we uttered
To each other
You played your part in this

Oh, I played hide-and-go-seek
Safe behind your veneer
Does it bury your burden baby
Makes it all disappear
But those marks on your thighs
Don't they sting when you bleed
It's the way that you are
And the way I'll forever be

Swallowed my soul
Dragging me down

Seven miles from my front porch

Bundle up and come with me now
Down the road to the burnt down barn
We could make a blanket of coats
And breathe our souls into the neighbours front lawn

Trouble that does not search words
It sprung from the biblical vine
And are waiting to return to the dirt

The stitches in your winter clothes
Your cello bows
We stole your hair to make them
We're sorry for the iron shoes
We nailed to you
And stuck you in the rain alone
You sprinted away, sprinted away
To where I don't know
God's moving in your bloodstream
Where the cross beats aren't so slow

You swept all the red from my cheeks
I didn't hear you come back inside
And light up the gas in the den
And stand there in the thin winter light
But oh god that curve in your spine
A question mark 
A doctor sign was framed by the windowsill
And you saw something I did not in the night
You saw something I did not in the night

Bright Eyes,"No Lies, Just Love","It was in the march of the winter I turned seventeen
That I bought those pills
I thought I would need
And I wrote a letter to my family
Said it's not your fault
And you've been good to me
Just lately I've been feeling
Like I don't belong
Like the ground's not mine to walk upon
And I've heard that music
Echo through the house
Where my grandmother drank
By herself
And I sat watching a flower
As it was withering
I was embarrassed by its honesty
So I'd prefer to be remembered as a smiling face
Not this fucking wreck
That's taken its place

So please forgive what I have done
No you can't stay mad at the setting sun
'Cause we all get tired, I mean eventually
There is nothing left to do but sleep

But spring came bearing sunlight
Those persuasive rays
So I gave myself a few more days
My salvation it came, quite suddenly
When Justin spoke very plainly
He said ""Of course it's your decision,
But just so you know,
If you decide to leave,
Soon I will follow""

I wrote this for a baby
Who has yet to be born
My brother's first child
I hope that womb's not too warm
'Cause it's cold out here
And it'll be quite a shock
To breathe this air
To discover loss
So I'd like to make some changes
Before you arive
So when your new eyes meet mine
They won't see no lies
Just love.
Just love.

When we couldn't sleep for all the heat,
Soft talk began to harden.

The fact they're good at making,
Miss your sitting up incessantly,
And the fact you're always waking in the night, night.
And I,
I hope for your life
You forget about mine
Forget about mine
Miss your teeth dug in my shoulder,
As we rolled in early morning,
Miss your arm dying beneath me,
As I lay there simply yawning
Please forget me, you were right dear,
I am cold and self-involved,
And though I'll miss you, recent lover
I am weak and therefore fold
Get distracted by my music,
Think of nothing else but art
I'll write my loneliness in poems,
If I can just think how to start
Dot my I's with eyebrow pencils,
Close my eyelids, hide my eyes,
I'll be idle in my ideals,
Think of nothing else but I.

Lana Del Ray,Young and Beautiful,"I've seen the world, done it all
Had my cake now
Diamonds, brilliant, in Bel-Air now
Hot summer nights, mid July
When you and I were forever wild
The crazy days, city lights
The way you'd play with me like a child

When I've got nothing but my aching soul?
I know you will, I know you will
I know that you will
Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful?

As my stage now
Channeling angels in a new age now
Hot summer days, rock and roll
The way you play for me at your show
And all the ways, I got to know
Your pretty face and electric soul
Will you still love me
When I'm no longer young and beautiful?
Will you still love me
When I've got nothing but my aching soul?

I know that you will
Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful?
Dear lord, when I get to heaven
Please let me bring my man
When he comes tell me that you'll let him in

All that face, makes me wanna party

Regina Spektor,The Call,"It started out as a feeling
Which then grew into a hope
Which then turned into a quiet thought
Which then turned into a quiet word
And then that word grew louder and louder
'Til it was a battle cry
I'll come back
When you call me
No need to say goodbye
Just because everything's changing
Doesn't mean it's never been this way before
All you can do is try to know who your friends are
As you head off to the war
Pick a star on the dark horizon
And follow the light
You'll come back when it's over
No need to say goodbye
You'll come back when it's over
No need to say goodbye
Now we're back to the beginning
It's just a feeling and no one knows yet
But just because they can't feel it too
Doesn't mean that you have to forget
Let your memories grow stronger and stronger
'Til they're before your eyes
You'll come back
When they call you
No need to say goodbye
You'll come back
When they call you
No need to say goodbye",sad,2008

You
My darling, you...

Bittersweet memories –

And I... will always love you
I... will always love you
You, ooh

A moment a love
A dream aloud

Our rights
Our wrongs
A moment, a love

Gotye,Somebody That I Used to Know,"Now and then I think of when we were together
Like when you said you felt so happy you could die
Told myself that you were right for me
But felt so lonely in your company
But that was love and it's an ache I still remember
You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
Like resignation to the end, always the end
So when we found that we could not make sense
Well you said that we would still be friends
But I'll admit that I was glad it was over
But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough
No, you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over
But had me believing it was always something that I'd done
But I don't wanna live that way
Reading into every word you say
You said that you could let it go
And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know
But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough
No, you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Somebody (I used to know)

Josh Groban,Remember When it Rained,"Wash away the thoughts inside
That keep my mind away from you
No more love and no more pride
And thoughts are all I have to do
Ooh remember when it rained
I felt the ground and look up high 
And called your name
Ooh remember when it rained
In the darkness I remain
Tears of hope run down my skin
Tears for you that will not dry
They magnify the one within
And let the outside slowly die
Ooh remember when it rained
I felt the ground and looked up high
And called your name
Ooh remember when it rained
In the water I remain
Running down
Oh oh oh 
No no no
Oh oh oh, running down",sad,2003
The Fray,You Found Me,"I found God on the corner of First in Amistad
Where the west was all but won
All alone
Smoking his last cigarette
I said where you been?
He said, ask anything
Where were you
When everything was falling apart?
All my days
Spent by the telephone
That never rang
And all I needed was a call
That never came
From the corner of First and Amistad
Lost and insecure
You found me, you found me
Lying on the floor
Surrounded, surrounded
Why'd you have to wait?
Where were you, where were you?
Just a little late
You found me, you found me
In the end
Everyone ends up alone
Losing her
The only one who's ever known
Who I am, who I'm not, and who I wanna be
No way to know
How long she will be next to me
Lost and insecure
You found me, you found me
Lying on the floor
Surrounded, surrounded
Why'd you have to wait?
Where were you, where were you?
Just a little late
You found me, you found me
Early morning
City breaks
I've been calling
For years and years and years and years
And you never left me no messages
You never send me no letters
You got some kind of nerve
Taking all I want
Lost and insecure
You found me, you found me
Lying on the floor
Where were you? Where were you?
Lost and insecure
You found me, you found me
Lying on the floor
Surrounded, surrounded

Evanescence,My Immortal,"I'm so tired of being here
Suppressed by all my childish fears
And if you have to leave
I wish that you would just leave
'Cause your presence still lingers here
And it won't leave me alone
These wounds won't seem to heal, this pain is just too real
There's just too much that time cannot erase
When you cried, I'd wipe away all of your tears
When you'd scream, I'd fight away all of your fears
And I held your hand through all of these years
But you still have all of me
You used to captivate me by your resonating light
Now, I'm bound by the life you left behind
Your face it haunts my once pleasant dreams
Your voice it chased away all the sanity in me
These wounds won't seem to heal, this pain is just too real
There's just too much that time cannot erase
When you cried, I'd wipe away all of your tears
When you'd scream, I'd fight away all of your fears
And I held your hand through all of these years
But you still have all of me
I've tried so hard to tell myself that you're gone
But though you're still with me, I've been alone all along
When you cried, I'd wipe away all of your tears
When you'd scream, I'd fight away all of your fears
And I held your hand through all of these years
You still have all of me, me, me",sad,2000

The Fray,How to Save a Life,"Step one, you say we need to talk
He walks, you say sit down, it's just a talk
He smiles politely back at you
You stare politely right on through
Some sort of window to your right
As he goes left, and you stay right
Between the lines of fear and blame
You begin to wonder why you came
Where did I go wrong?
I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life
Let him know that you know best
Cause after all, you do know best
Try to slip past his defense
Without granting innocence
Lay down a list of what is wrong
The things you've told him all along
And pray to God he hears you
And I pray to God he hears you
Where did I go wrong?
I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life
As he begins to raise his voice
You lower yours and grant him one last choice
Drive until you lose the road
Or break with the ones you've followed
He will do one of two things
He will admit to everything
Or he'll say he's just not the same
And you'll begin to wonder why you came
Where did I go wrong?
I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life
Where did I go wrong?
I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness

Never let a wound ruin me
But I feel like ruin's wooing me
Arrow holes that never close from cupid on a shooting spree
Feeling stupid cause I know it ain't no you and me
But when you're trying to beat the odds up
Been trying to keep your nods up and you know that you should know
And let her go but the fear of the unknown

Trying to write yourself a rifle
Maybe sharpen up a song
To fight the tanks and drones of you being alone

I wish that I could stop loving you so much

She waits a little longer
There's no one in the driveway
No ones' said they've seen him
Why, is something wrong?
She looks back to the window
Suddenly the phone rings
A voice says, something's happened
That she should come right now
Her mind goes to December
She thinks of when he asked her
He bent down on his knee first
And he said
I want you forever
Forever and always
Through the good and the bad and the ugly
We'll grow old together
Forever and always

She walks right to the front desk
They lead her though a million halls
A maze that's never ending
They talk about what happened
But she can barely hear them
She tries to keep a straight face
As she walks into the room
She sits by his bedside
Holds his hand too tight
They talk about the kids they're gonna have
And the good life
The house on the hillside
Where they would
Stay, stay there forever
Forever and always
Through the good and the bad and the ugly
We'll grow old together
And always remember
Whether rich or for poor or for better
We'll still love each other

And calls in the nurses
Brings up the chaplain
And he says a couple verses
She borrows some rings
From the couple next door
Everybody's laughing
As the tears fall on the floor
She looks into his eyes and she says
I want you forever
Forever and always
Through the good and the bad and the ugly
We'll grow old together
And always remember
Whether happy or sad or whatever
We'll still love each other
Forever and always
Forever and always

I'll always love you

Where do they all belong?
Ah look at all the lonely people

My back is turned on you
Should've known you'd bring me heartache
Almost lovers always do
We walked along a crowded street
You took my hand and danced with me
Images
And when you left, you kissed my lips
You told me you would never, never forget
These images
Well, I'd never want to see you unhappy
I thought you'd want the same for me
Goodbye, my almost lover
Goodbye, my hopeless dream
I'm trying not to think about you
Can't you just let me be?
So long, my luckless romance
My back is turned on you
Should've known you'd bring me heartache
Almost lovers always do
I cannot go to the ocean
I cannot drive the streets at night
I cannot wake up in the morning
Without you on my mind
So you're gone and I'm haunted
And I bet you are just fine
Did I make it that easy to walk right in and out
Of my life?
Goodbye, my almost lover
Goodbye, my hopeless dream
I'm trying not to think about you
Can't you just let me be?
So long, my luckless romance
My back is turned on you
Should've known you'd bring me heartache
Almost lovers always do",sad,2007

Beth Sass,Watercolor Lake,"Watercolor Lake surrounds you
Knows you will not take much more
So all it does it wait


While your face stays frozen

Watercolor Lake raised you
Offered its embrace
And when you came of age
It glowed and glistened

While your life falls apart we walk around the lake
As each footstep tells the truth the light through the leaves reveals
Every last mistake on Watercolor Lake

Watercolor lake brought you
Here to contemplate
Maybe it is safe to hate your poison
Watercolor Lake warned me
Tell it to her face ….scream until you break the whole thing opened

While your life falls apart we walk around the lake
As each footstep tells the truth the light through the leaves reveals
Every last mistake on Watercolor Lake

It's so still on the surface
You can see the sky in the water
You will survive
If you believe your eyes

Watercolor lake was born
When a river in a storm
Needed room to run
When overflowing

Watercolor lake knows
There is no easy way
But someday we will both
Be celebrating

While your life falls apart we walk around the lake
As each footstep tells the truth the light through the leaves reveals
Every last mistake on Watercolor Lake",sad,2012

Forget what we're told
Before we get too old
Show me a garden that's bursting into life

Chasing cars
Around our heads
I need your grace
To remind me
To find my own
If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world?
Forget what we're told
Before we get too old
Show me a garden that's bursting into life

All that I ever was
Is here in your perfect eyes, they're all I can see

Just know that these things will never change for us at all

One day soon I'm gonna tell the moon about the crying game

Why there are heartaches, why there are tears?

And what to do to stop feeling blue when love disappears?

The ghosts of my life blow wilder than before 
Just when I thought I could not be stopped 
When my chance came to be king 
The ghosts of my life blew wilder than the wind
Well I'm feeling nervous 
Now I find myself alone 
The simple life's no longer there 
Once I was so sure 
Now the doubt inside my mind 
Comes and goes but leads nowhere

Of Montreal,The Past is a Grotesque Animal,"The past is a grotesque animal and in its eyes, you see
How completely wrong you can be
How completely wrong you can be

The sun is out, it melts the snow that fell yesterday
Makes you wonder why it bothered

I fell in love with the first cute girl that I met
Who could appreciate Georges Bataille
Standing at a Swedish festival
Discussing Story of the Eye
Discussing Story of the Eye

It's so embarrassing to need someone like I do you
How can I explain?
I need you here and not here too
How can I explain?
I need you here and not here too

I'm flunking out, I'm flunking out
I'm gone, I'm just gone
But at least I author my own disaster
At least I author my own disaster

Performance breakdown and I don't want to hear it
I'm just not available
Things could be different, but they're not
Oh, oh, things could be different, but they're not The mousy girl screams, ""Violence, violence!""
The mousy girl screams, ""Violence, violence!""
She gets hysterical
'Cause they're both so mean
And it's my favorite scene

But the cruelty's so predictable
It makes you sad on the stage
Though our love project has so much potential
But it's like we weren't made for this world
Though I wouldn't really want to meet someone who was

Do I have to scream in your face?
I've been dodging lamps and vegetables
Throw it all in my face
I don't care

Let's just have some fun
Let's tear this shit apart
Let's tear the fucking house apart
Let's tear our fucking bodies apart
Let's just have some fun

Somehow, you've red-rovered the Gestapo circling my heart
And nothing can defeat you -- no death, no ugly world
You've lived so brightly -- you've altered everything
I find myself searching for old selves
While speeding forward through the plate glass of maturing cells I've played the unraveler, the parhelion
But even Apocalypse is fleeting
There's no death, no ugly world
Sometimes, I wonder if you're mythologizing me like I do you
Mythologizing me like I do you

We want our film to be beautiful, not realistic
Perceive me in the radiance of terror dreams
You can betray me
You can...
You can betray me

Teach me something wonderful
Crown my head, crowd my head with your lilting effects
Project your fears onto me
I need to view them
See there's nothing to them
I promise you, there's nothing to them

I'm so touched by your goodness
You make me feel so criminal
How do you keep it together?
I'm all, all unraveled

But you know no matter where we are
We're always touching by underground wires I've explored you with the detachment of an analyst
But most nights, we've raided the same kingdoms
And none of our secrets are physical
None of our secrets are physical
None of our secrets are physical now",sad,2007

we've been tight since Percy Elementary
class of 1985
we moved together out to Philly after college
took a two bedroom at South & 9th
I sold my violin so we could have it easy
El got her grandmother's money when she died

we laughed like we were queens
& split our ballgowns at the seams
& every single time I'd dream
it was only El & me
but then she slipped away from me
she met a boy from New Jersey
& they fell fast in love of course
I swear it felt like a divorce

this September I'll be 26 years old
& El's the only one besides my dad
who's ever said I love you Creedence

took got a job downtown
it's an hour on the bus each way
typing letters for a lawyer in a bad toupee
it's dumb I know but it pays okay

& did I mention I moved out
I got my own place off of South
& I've been living hand to mouth
for going on a year by now
& yes I still see El around
it's different but I can't say how
she cut her hair it's back to brown
she's living with her boyfriend now

& since September I've been 26 years old
she's still the only one besides my dad

Kate Bush,Moments of Pleasure,"Some moments that I've had
Some moments of pleasure

I think about us lying
Lying on a beach somewhere
I think about us diving
Diving off a rock, into another moment

The case of George the Wipe
Oh God I can't stop laughing
This sense of humour of mine
It isn't funny at all
Oh but we sit up all night
Talking about it

Just being alive
It can really hurt
And these moments given
Are a gift from time

On a balcony in New York
It's just started to snow
He meets us at the lift
Like Douglas Fairbanks
Waving his walking stick
But he isn't well at all
The buildings of New York
Look just like mountains through the snow

Just being alive
It can really hurt
And these moments given
Are a gift from time
Just let us try
To give these moments back
To those we love
To those who will survive

And I can hear my mother saying
""Every old sock meets an old shoe""
Isn't that a great saying?
""Every old sock meets an old shoe""

So I think I'll just act bored instead
And contain the blood I would've shed?
She makes me feel so ill at ease
My heart is really on it's knees
But I keep a poker face so well
That even mother couldn't tell
But my baby's so vain
She is almost a mirror
And the sound of her name
Sends a permanent shiver down my
Spine
I keep her photograph against my heart
For in my life she plays a starring part
All alcohol and cigarettes
There is no room for cheap regrets
She makes me feel so ill at ease
My heart is really on it's knees
But I keep a poker face so well
That even mother couldn't tell
But my baby's so vain
She is almost a mirror
And the sound of her name
Sends a permanent shiver down my
Spine",sad,1979
Ian Dury,My Old Man,"My old man wore three piece whistles
He was never home for long
Drove a bus for London Transport
He knew where he belonged
Number eighteeen down to Euston
Double decker move along
Double decker move along
My old man
Later on he drove a Roller
Chauffeuring for foreign men
Dropped his aitches on occasion
Said ""Cor blimey!"" now and then
Did the crossword in the Standard
At the airport in the rain
At the airport in the rain
My old man
Wouldn't ever let his governors
Call him 'Billy', he was proud
Personal reasons make a difference
His last boss was allowed
Perhaps he had to keep his distance
Made a racket when he rowed
Made a racket when he rowed
My old man
My old man
My old man was fairly handsome
He smoked too many cigs
Lived in one room in Victoria
He was tidy in his digs
Had to have an operation
When his ulcer got too big
When his ulcer got too big
My old man
My old man
Seven years went out the window
We met as one to one
Died before we'd done much talking
Relations had begun
All the while we thought about each other
All the best, mate, from your son
All the best, mate, from your son

Mark Kozelek,Ruth Marie,"I grew so old in that house I lived in
They brought me here 'cause I can't take care
I lost my worth and my purpose here
I feel you cry, but I can't speak my mind
Will you hold me and never let me go?
'Cause I hated when you walk outside that door
'Cause I know I won't ever see your eyes
The eyes I gave you
When my eyes shut, they'll take me to the land
For fifty years I lived there with my man
And on my own, I lived for forty more
I watched you grow up from babies on the floor
To the beautiful women that you are
And I hated that you've gone away so far
'Cause I know I won't ever see those eyes
The eyes I gave you
The evenings fall, they'll drag me out the hall
Up to my bunk and drug me 'til I'm numb
But pass the haze, I see your pretty face
Remember me when I'm gone
You know I love you, though I can hardly say
And I hate it when you see me in this way
But in darkness, I'll always see those eyes
The eyes I gave you",sad,2000
The Shangri-Las,"Past, Present and Future","The past, past, well now let me tell you about the past
The past is filled with silent joys and broken toys
Laughing girls and teasing boys
Was I ever in love? I called it love- I mean, it felt like love
There were moments when, well, there were moments when

Present, Go out with you? Why not
Do I like to dance? Of Course
Take a walk along the beach tonight? I'd love to
But don't try to touch me, don't try to touch me
'cause that will never happen again
Shall we dance

[Instrumental]

The future, tomorrow? well tomorrows a long way off
Maybe someday I'll have somebody's hand
Maybe somewhere someone will understand
You know I used to sing- a tisket a tasket a green and yellow basket
I'm all packed up and I'm on my way and I'm gonna fall in love
But at the moment it doesn't look good
At the moment it will never happen again

I don't think it will ever happen again",sad,1965
Sufjan Stevens,Death With Dignity,"Spirit of my silence I can hear you
But I'm afraid to be near you
And I don't know where to begin
And I don't know where to begin
Somewhere in the desert there's a forest
And an acre before us
But I don't know where to begin
But I don't know where to begin
Again I've lost my strength completely, oh be near me
Tired old mare with the wind in your hair
Amethyst and flowers on the table, is it real or a fable?
Well I suppose a friend is a friend
And we all know how this will end
Chimney swift that finds me, be my keeper
Silhouette of the cedar
What is that song you sing for the dead?
What is that song you sing for the dead?
I see the signal searchlight strike me in the window of my room
Well I got nothing to prove
Well I got nothing to prove
I forgive you, mother, I can hear you
And I long to be near you
But every road leads to an end
Yes every road leads to an end
Your apparition passes through me in the willows
Five red hens – you'll never see us again
You'll never see us again",sad,2015
Joni Mitchell,Blue,"[Verse 1]
Blue
Songs are like tattoos
You know I've been to sea before
Crown and anchor me
Or let me sail away

[Verse 2]
Hey, blue
There is a song for you
Ink on a pin
Underneath the skin
An empty space to fill in

[Bridge]
Well, there's so many sinking now
You gotta keep thinking
You can make it trough these waves
Acid, booze, and ass
Needles, guns, and grass
Lots of laughs
Lots of laughs

Everybody's saying that
Hell's the hippest way to go
Well, I don't think so
But I'm gonna take a look around it, though
Blue, I love you [Verse 3]
Blue, there is a shell for you
Inside you'll hear a sigh
A foggy lullaby
There is your song from me",sad,1971
Otis Redding,A Change Is Gonna Come,"I was born by a river, oh man, in this little old tent, oh

I said ""Mother!""
I said ""Mother! I'm down on my knees""

Just like I said, I went to my little bitty brother, oh my little brother now
I asked my brother ""Brother help me please?"", oh now
He turned me down and then I go to my little mother, my dear mother, oh my

And standing up alone

She'll find the note I left hangin' on her door
She'll laugh when she reads the part that says I'm leavin'
'Cause I've left that girl so many times before
By the time I make Albuquerque she'll be working
She'll prob'ly stop at lunch and give me a call
But she'll just hear that phone keep on ringin'
Off the wall that's all
By the time I make Oklahoma she'll be sleepin'
She'll turn softly and call my name out loud
And she'll cry just to think I'd really leave her
Tho' time and time I try to tell her so
She just didn't know I would really go.",sad,1969

Come crashing in
Into my little world
Painful to me
Pierce right through me
Can't you understand
Oh my little girl

All I ever wanted
All I ever needed
Is here in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm

Vows are spoken
To be broken
Feelings are intense
Words are trivial
Pleasures remain
So does the pain
Words are meaningless
And forgettable

All I ever needed

 Joy Division,Isolation,"In fear every day, every evening,
He calls her aloud from above,
Carefully watched for a reason,
Painstaking devotion and love,
Surrendered to self preservation,
From others who care for themselves.
A blindness that touches perfection,
But hurts just like anything else.

Isolation, isolation, isolation.

Mother I tried please believe me,
I'm doing the best that I can.
I'm ashamed of the things I've been put through,
I'm ashamed of the person I am.

Isolation, isolation, isolation.

But if you could just see the beauty,
These things I could never describe,
These pleasures a wayward distraction,
This is my one lucky prize.

Robert Wyatt,Shipbuilding,"Is it worth it?
A new winter coat and shoes for the wife
And a bicycle on the boy's birthday.
It's just a rumor that was spread around town
By the women and children, soon we'll be shipbuilding
Well I ask you
The boy said 'Dad, they're going to take me to task
But I'll be home by Christmas.
It's just a rumor that was spread around town
Somebody said that someone got filled in
For saying that people get killed in
The results of their shipbuilding.
With all the will in the world
Diving for dear life
When we could be diving for pearls.
It's just a rumor that was spread around town
A telegram for a picture postcard
Within weeks they'll be reopening the shipyard
And notifying the next of kin
Once again.
It's all we're skilled in
We will be shipbuilding.
With all the will in the world
Diving for dear life
When we could be diving for pearls.",sad,2010
Billie Holiday,Strange Fruit,"Southern trees bear strange fruit
Blood on the leaves and blood at the root
Black bodies swinging in the southern breeze
Strange fruit hanging from the poplar trees
Pastoral scene of the gallant south
The bulging eyes and the twisted mouth
Scent of magnolias, sweet and fresh
Then the sudden smell of burning flesh
Here is fruit for the crows to pluck
For the rain to gather, for the wind to suck
For the sun to rot, for the trees to drop
Here is a strange and bitter crop",sad,1965

You should see someone about a cold drink, I don't know, I'm delirious' night'
Cups of the Rose
Bitches in my old phone
I should call one and go home

Is happy wit a good guy
But I've been drinking so much
That I'ma call her anyway and say
Fuck that nigga that you love so bad
I know you still think about the times we had
I say fuck that nigga that you think you found
And since you picked up I know he's not around

Tell me have you heard that lately?
I'm just sayin' you could do better
And I'll start hatin', only if you make me

Bitches came over, yeah, we threw a party
I was just calling 'cause they were just leaving
Talk to me please, don't have much to believe in
I need you right now, are you down to listen to me?
Too many drinks have been given to me
I got some women that's living off me
Paid for their flights and hotels I'm ashamed
Bet that you know them, I won't say no names
After a while girl they all seem the same
I've had sex four times this week I'll explain
Having a hard time adjusting to fame
Sprite in that mixture, I've been talking crazy girl
I'm lucky that you picked up
Lucky that you stayed on

The Cure,Disintegration,"Oh, I miss the kiss of treachery
The shameless kiss of vanity
The soft and the black and the velvety
Up tight against the side of me

And mouth and eyes and heart all bleed
And run in thickening streams of greed
As bit by bit it starts the need
To just let go my party piece

Oh, I miss the kiss of treachery
The aching kiss before I feed
The stench of a love for a younger meat
And the sound that it makes when it cuts in deep
The holding up on bended knees
The addiction of duplicities
As bit by bit it starts the need
To just let go my party piece

But I never said I would stay to the end
So I leave you with babies and hoping for frequency
Screaming like this in the hope of the secrecy
Screaming me over and over and over
I leave you with photographs, pictures of trickery
Stains on the carpet and stains on the scenery
Songs about happiness murmured in dreams
When we both of us knew how the ending would be So it's all come back round to breaking apart again
Breaking apart like I'm made up of glass again
Making it up behind my back again
Holding my breath for the fear of sleep again
Holding it up behind my head again
Cut in the deep to the heart of the bone again
Round and round and round and it's coming apart again
Over and over and over

And now that I know that I'm breaking to pieces
I'll pull out my heart and I'll feed it to anyone
I'm crying for sympathy, crocodiles cry
For the love of the crowd
And the three cheers from everyone
Dropping through sky
Through the glass of the roof
Through the roof of your mouth
Through the mouth of your eye
Through the eye of the needle
It's easier for me to get closer to Heaven
Than ever feel whole again

But I never said I would stay to the end
I knew I would leave you with babies and everything
Screaming like this in the hope of sincerity
Screaming it's over and over and over
I leave you with photographs, pictures of trickery
Stains on the carpet and stains on the memory
Songs about happiness murmured in dreams
When we both of us knew how the end always is
How the end always is How the end always is
How the end always is
How the end always is
How the end always is
Always is

With someone new I couldn't start it
Too late, for beginnings
The little things that made me nervous
Are gone, in a moment
I miss the way we used to argue
Locked, in your basement
I wake up and the phone is ringing
Surprised, as it's early
And that should be the perfect warning
That something's a problem
To tell the truth I saw it coming
The way you were breathing
But nothing can prepare you for it
The voice on the other end
The worst is all the lovely weather
I'm stunned, it's not raining
The coffee isn't even bitter
Because, what's the difference?
There's all the work that needs to be done
It's late, for revision
There's all the time and all the planning

Bruce Springsteen,The River,"I come from down in the valley
Where mister when you're young
They bring you up to do like your daddy done
Me and Mary we met in high school
When she was just seventeen
We'd ride out of this valley down to where the fields were green

We'd go down to the river
And into the river we'd dive
Oh down to the river we'd ride

Then I got Mary pregnant
And man that was all she wrote
And for my nineteenth birthday I got a union card and a wedding coat
We went down to the courthouse
And the judge put it all to rest
No wedding day smiles no walk down the aisle
No flowers no wedding dress

That night we went down to the river
And into the river we'd dive
Oh down to the river we did ride

I got a job working construction for the Johnstown Company
But lately there ain't been much work on account of the economy
Now all them things that seemed so important
Well mister they vanished right into the air
Now I just act like I don't remember
Mary acts like she don't care But I remember us riding in my brother's car
Her body tan and wet down at the reservoir
At night on them banks I'd lie awake
And pull her close just to feel each breath she'd take
Now those memories come back to haunt me
They haunt me like a curse
Is a dream a lie if it don't come true
Or is it something worse
That sends me down to the river
Though I know the river is dry
That sends me down to the river tonight
Down to the river
My baby and I
Oh down to the river we ride",sad,1980

Is there somethin' I can send you from across the sea
From the place that I’ll be landing?

No, there’s nothin' you can send me, my own true love
There’s nothin' Im'a wishing to be ownin'
Just a-carry yourself back to me unspoiled
From across that lonesome ocean

Ah, but I just thought you might want somethin' fine
Made of silver or of golden
Either from the mountains of Madrid
Or from the coast of Barcelona

Well, if I had the stars from the darkest night
And the diamonds from the deepest ocean
I’d forsake them all for your sweet kiss
For that’s all I’m a-wishin' to be ownin'

Well I might be gone a long old time
And it’s only that I’m asking
Is there somethin' I can send you to remember me by
To make your time more easy passing

Oh, how can, how can you ask me again
It only brings me sorrow
The same thing I would want today
I want again tomorrow I got a letter on a lonesome day
It was from her ship a-sailin'
Sayin' I don’t know when I’ll be comin' back again
It depends on how I’m a-feelin'

If a-you, my love, must think that-a-way
I’m sure your mind is a-roamin'
I’m sure your thoughts are not with me
But with the country to where you’re goin'

So take heed, take heed of the western wind
Take heed of the stormy weather
And yes, there’s somethin' you can send back to me

The Streets,Dry Your Eyes,"In one single moment your whole life can turn around, I stand there for a minute staring straight into the ground.
Looking to the left slightly then looking back down the world feels like its caved in proper sorry frown. 
Please let me show you how we could only just be for us, I can change and I can grow or we can adjust. The wicked thing about us is we always have trust. 
We can even have an open relationship if we must. 
I look at her, she stares almost straight back at me but her eyes glaze over like she's looking straight through me. 
Then her eyes must have closed for what seems an eternity, when they opened up she's lookin down at her feet.
Dry your eyes mate, I know it's hard to take but her mind has been made up.
There's plenty more fish in the sea.
Dry your eyes mate, I know you want to make her see how much this pain hurts, but you've got to walk away now, its over.
So then I moved my hand off and down by my side, shaking, my life is crashing before my eyes.
I turn the palm of my hand up to face the skies, touched the bottom of her chin and let out a sigh.
Because I can't imagine my life without you and me, there's things I can't imagine doing, things I can't imagine seeing.
It weren't supposed to be easy, surely, please please, I'm begging, please.
She brings her hands up towards where my hands rested she wraps her fingers around mine with the softness she's blessed with.
She peels away my fingers looks at me and then gestures, by pushing my hand away to my chest from hers.
Dry your eyes mate, I know it's hard to take but her mind has been made up.
There's plenty more fish in the sea.
Dry your eyes mate, I know you want to make her see how much this pain hurts, but you've got to walk away now, its over.
And I'm just standing there.
I can't say a word.
'Cause everything has just gone.
I've got nothing.
Absolutely nothing.
Trying to pull her close out of bare desperation, put my arms around her to try to change what she's saying.
Put my head level with hers so she might engage in.
Look into her eyes to make her listen again, I'm not gonna fuckin' just fuckin' just leave it all now.
'cause you said it would be forever and that was your vow, and your gonna let our things simply crash and fall down.
Your well out of order now, this is well out of town.
She pulls away, my arms that are tightly clamped around her waist gently pushes me back as she looks at me straight.
Turns around so she's now got her back to my face, takes one step forward, looks back and then walks away.
Dry your eyes mate, I know it's hard to take but her mind has been made up.
There's plenty more fish in the sea.
Dry your eyes mate, I know you want to make her see how much this pain hurts, but you've got to walk away now, its over.
I know in the past I've found it hard to say, telling you things but not telling you straight. But the more I pull on your hand the more you pull away.
Dry your eyes mate, I know it's hard to take but her mind has been made up.
There's plenty more fish in the sea.
Dry your eyes mate, I know you want to make her see how much this pain hurts, but you've got to walk away now.",sad,2004
Simon & Garfunkel,The Boxer,"I am just a poor boy
Though my story's seldom told
I have squandered my resistance
For a pocket full of mumbles, such are promises
All lies and jests
Still a man hears what he wants to hear
And disregards the rest
When I left my home and my family
I was no more than a boy
In the company of strangers
In the quiet of the railway station
Running scared,
Laying low, seeking out the poorer quarters
Where the ragged people go
Looking for the places
Only they would know
Lie la lie, lie la la la lie lie
Lie la lie, lie la la la la lie la la lie
Asking only workman's wages
I come looking for a job
But I get no offers
Just a come-on from the whores
On Seventh Avenue
I do declare
There were times when I was so lonesome
I took some comfort there, le le le le le le le
Lie la lie, lie la la la lie lie
Lie la lie, lie la la la la lie la la lie
Then I'm laying out my winter clothes
And wishing I was gone
Going home
Where the New York City winters
Aren't bleeding me
Leading me
Going home
In the clearing stands a boxer
And a fighter by his trade
And he carries the reminders
Of ev'ry glove that laid him down
Or cut him till he cried out
In his anger and his shame
""I am leaving, I am leaving""
But the fighter still remains, mmm mmm
Lie la lie, lie la la la lie lie
Lie la lie, lie la la la la lie la la lie
Lie la lie, lie la la la lie lie
Lie la lie, lie la la la la lie la la lie
Lie la lie, lie la la la lie lie
Lie la lie, lie la la la la lie la la lie
Lie la lie, lie la la la lie lie
Lie la lie, lie la la la la lie la la lie
Lie la lie, lie la la la lie lie
Lie la lie, lie la la la la lie la la lie
Lie la lie, lie la la la lie lie
Lie la lie, lie la la la la lie la la lie
Lie la lie, lie la la la lie lie
Lie la lie, lie la la la la lie la la lie
Lie la lie, lie la la la lie lie
Lie la lie, lie la la la la lie la la lie",sad,1970
Elliott Smith,No Name #5,"Got bitten fingernails and a head full of the past
And everybody's gone at last
Sweet, sweet smile that's fading fast
'Cos everybody's gone at last
Don't get upset about it
No not anymore
There's nothing wrong that wasn't wrong before
Had a second alone with a chance let pass
And everybody's gone at last

Well I hope you're not waiting
Waiting 'round for me
'Cos I'm not going anywhere, obviously
Got a broken heart and your name on my cast
And everybody's gone at last
Everybody's gone at last",sad,1997
Tom Waits,Tom Traubert’s Blues,"Wasted and wounded, it ain't what the moon did
Got what I paid for now
See ya tomorrow, hey Frank can I borrow
A couple of bucks from you?
To go waltzing Mathilda, waltzing Mathilda
You'll go a-waltzing Mathilda with me
I'm an innocent victim of a blinded alley
And tired of all these soldiers here
No one speaks English and everything's broken
And my Stacys are soaking wet
To go waltzing Mathilda, waltzing Mathilda
You'll go a-waltzing Mathilda with me
Now the dogs are barking and the taxi cab's parking
A lot they can do for me
I begged you to stab me, you tore my shirt open
And I'm down on my knees tonight
Old Bushmill's I staggered, you buried the dagger
Your silhouette window light
To go waltzing Mathilda, waltzing Mathilda
You'll go a-waltzing Mathilda with me
Now I lost my Saint Christopher now that I've kissed her
And the one-armed bandit knows
And the maverick Chinaman and the cold-blooded signs
And the girls down by the strip-tease shows
Go, waltzing Mathilda, waltzing Mathilda
You'll go a-waltzing Mathilda with me
No, I don't want your sympathy
The fugitives say that the streets aren't for dreaming now
Manslaughter dragnets and the ghosts that sell memories
They want a piece of the action anyhow
Go, waltzing Mathilda, waltzing Mathilda
You'll go a-waltzing Mathilda with me
And you can ask any sailor and the keys from the jailor
And the old men in wheelchairs know
That Mathilda's the defendant, she killed about a hundred
And she follows wherever you may go
Waltzing Mathilda, waltzing Mathilda
You'll go a-waltzing Mathilda with me
And it's a battered old suitcase to a hotel someplace
And a wound that will never heal
No prima donna, the perfume is on
An old shirt that is stained with blood and whiskey
And goodnight to the street sweepers
The night watchman flame keepers and goodnight, Mathilda too",sad,1976
Neil Young,Only Love Can Break Your Heart,"When you were young
And on your own
How did it feel to be alone
I was always thinking of games
That I was playing
Trying to make the best of my time
But only love can break your heart
Try to be sure right from the start
Yes, only love can break your heart
What if your world should fall apart
I have a friend I've never seen
He hides his head inside a dream
Someone should call him and see
If he can come out
Trying to lose the down that he's found
But only love can break your heart
Try to be sure right from the start
Yes, only love can break your heart
What if your world should fall apart
I have a friend I've never seen
He hides his head inside a dream
Yes, only love can break your heart
Yes, only love can break your heart
Yes, only love can break your heart
Yes, only love can break your heart
Yes, only love can break your heart",sad,2014
The Smiths,I Know It’s Over,"Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head 
And as I climb into an empty bed 
Oh well. Enough said. 
I know it's over - still I cling 
I don't know where else I can go 
Oh...
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head 
See, the sea wants to take me 
The knife wants to slit me 
Do you think you can help me?
Sad veiled bride, please be happy 
Handsome groom, give her room 
Loud, loutish lover, treat her kindly 
(Though she needs you 
More than she loves you) 
And I know it's over - still I cling 
I don't know where else I can go 
Over and over and over and over 
Over and over, la...
I know it's over 
And it never really began 
But in my heart it was so real
And you even spoke to me, and said : 
""If you're so funny 
Then why are you on your own tonight ? 
And if you're so clever 
Then why are you on your own tonight ? 
If you're so very entertaining 
Then why are you on your own tonight ? 
If you're so very good-looking 
Why do you sleep alone tonight ? 
I know...
'Cause tonight is just like any other night 
That's why you're on your own tonight 
With your triumphs and your charms 
While they're in each other's arms...""
It's so easy to laugh 
It's so easy to hate 
It takes strength to be gentle and kind 
Over, over, over, over
It's so easy to laugh 
It's so easy to hate 
It takes guts to be gentle and kind 
Over, over 
Love is natural and real 
But not for you, my love 
Not tonight, my love 
Love is natural and real 
But not for such as you and I, my love
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head 
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head 
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head 
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my ... 
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head 
Oh Mother, I can even feel the soil falling over my head 
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head 
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my...",sad,1986
